This document's goal is to provide a small amount of additional data for fine-tuning the model.

Rationale: The majority of the model's data is from the 1800s and early 1900s. As such, the
lexicon and grammar employed by the model are somewhat archaic (to-do: find an archaic synonym
for "somewhat").

For example, the model should be able to employ the term "Joplin" in various forms. E.g. by reading
"Joplin's GUI differs significantly between its React Native Android app and its Windows app" and
inserting punctuation appropriately.

Unfortunately, this file is likely to have little or no effect: It's very short compared to the other
documents in the training corpus, it only mentions the relevant terms a few times, and may occasionally
be included in the validation set, rather than the training set.

Here's the main text of the document:

Joplin is a note-taking and to-do application that supports Windows, Linux, iOS, Android, web, and other platforms.
Its iOS, Android, and web platforms were written using React Native. Its Windows, Linux, and MacOS apps
use Electron.

Electron is an interesting word. Usually, it's lowercase (e.g. "electron"). However, in some cases, it
should be uppercase (e.g. "Electron"). I'm curious - will the model be intelligent enough to recognize,
from context, which "electron" is being referred to?

I'm also curious how well the model will handle question punctuation. Will it be different in English and
French? The same? It's hard to say.

Here are a few sample questions:

Why is this program not working? Why are my sentences not properly punctuated? Why doesn't it properly punctuate the word "I'm"?

I am testing this application. Does it work?

What about names? Are names capitalized correctly? These are names: Bob, Canada, Greenland, Eve, Edward, Alice,
and Jabberwocky. Does it convert them correctly?

How about conjunctions? This is in the training data, so I'm including the conjunctions in sentences. This paragraph has a few: Haven't
you punctuated this sentence? She'll punctuate this sentence. They'll do something. I'm editing this file with a text editor. It's
adding the letters I type to the screen.

Though not present in much of the training data, common abbreviations should also be handled. Here are some: CPU, TPU, USA, EU, IRS, SEC, JS, TS, and RNN. The last one, RNN, stands for "Recurrent Neural Network".

On the topic of training data, many of the documents incorporated thus far are very old. As a result, they have long sentences with many commas.
I'm curious whether any modern texts could be incorporated. Doing so could improve the model's accuracy.

While preparing the training data, I've observed that the word "hello" is rather uncommon. It isn't
even included in the list of the 10,000 most common words! I expect "hello" to be more common in spoken text, which is one of the
things this project will be applied to. In addition to "hello", there's also "program", "computer", "phone", and "internet". Here's a
sentence that uses some of them: "My computer and phone can both access the internet".

Above, I've repeated "hello" a few times, so it is likely to now be included in the vocabulary. However, there may be
similar words that don't appear frequently in the training data. As such, while designing the model, we should be sure that
unknown words (like "hello") are preserved.

It would also be nice if "Joplin" was common enough to be included in the model's vocabulary. This would help ensure that the
model knows to properly capitalize it. I'm listing "Joplin" several times here as part of an effort to make this happen:
Joplin Desktop, Joplin Mobile, Joplin CLI, Joplin Web, Joplin's documentation, Joplin notebook, Joplin note, Joplin's editor, Joplin,
and Joplin.

Before deploying the model, it will be important to check for bias caused by its training data. For example, are certain pronouns and
honorifics over represented in the training data? Will the model understand "Mr. Name" but not "Ms. Name"?

I'm repeating the above text to emphasize it in the training data. This should offset some of the other sources, but runs the risk of
biasing the model towards my own writing.

Above, I've repeated "hello" a few times, so it is likely to now be included in the vocabulary. However, there may be
similar words that don't appear frequently in the training data. As such, while designing the model, we should be sure that
unknown words (like "hello") are preserved.

It would also be nice if "Joplin" was common enough to be included in the model's vocabulary. This would help ensure that the
model knows to properly capitalize it. I'm listing "Joplin" several times here as part of an effort to make this happen:
Joplin Desktop, Joplin Mobile, Joplin CLI, Joplin Web, Joplin's documentation, Joplin notebook, Joplin note, Joplin's editor, Joplin,
and Joplin.

Before deploying the model, it will be important to check for bias caused by its training data. For example, are certain pronouns and
honorifics over represented in the training data? Will the model understand "Mr. Name" but not "Ms. Name"?

I'm repeating the above text to emphasize it in the training data. This should offset some of the other sources, but runs the risk of
biasing the model towards my own writing.

This document's goal is to provide a small amount of additional data for fine-tuning the model.

Rationale: The majority of the model's data is from the 1800s and early 1900s. As such, the
lexicon and grammar employed by the model are somewhat archaic (to-do: find an archaic synonym
for "somewhat").

For example, the model should be able to employ the term "Joplin" in various forms. E.g. by reading
"Joplin's GUI differs significantly between its React Native Android app and its Windows app" and
inserting punctuation appropriately.

Unfortunately, this file is likely to have little or no effect: It's very short compared to the other
documents in the training corpus, it only mentions the relevant terms a few times, and may occasionally
be included in the validation set, rather than the training set.

Here's the main text of the document:

Joplin is a note-taking and to-do application that supports Windows, Linux, iOS, Android, web, and other platforms.
Its iOS, Android, and web platforms were written using React Native. Its Windows, Linux, and MacOS apps
use Electron.

Electron is an interesting word. Usually, it's lowercase (e.g. "electron"). However, in some cases, it
should be uppercase (e.g. "Electron"). I'm curious - will the model be intelligent enough to recognize,
from context, which "electron" is being referred to?

I'm also curious how well the model will handle question punctuation. Will it be different in English and
French? The same? It's hard to say.

Here are a few sample questions:

Why is this program not working? Why are my sentences not properly punctuated? Why doesn't it properly punctuate the word "I'm"?

I am testing this application. Does it work?

What about names? Are names capitalized correctly? These are names: Bob, Canada, Greenland, Eve, Edward, Alice,
and Jabberwocky. Does it convert them correctly?

How about conjunctions? This is in the training data, so I'm including the conjunctions in sentences. This paragraph has a few: Haven't
you punctuated this sentence? She'll punctuate this sentence. They'll do something. I'm editing this file with a text editor. It's
adding the letters I type to the screen.

Though not present in much of the training data, common abbreviations should also be handled. Here are some: CPU, TPU, USA, EU, IRS, SEC, JS, TS, and RNN. The last one, RNN, stands for "Recurrent Neural Network".

On the topic of training data, many of the documents incorporated thus far are very old. As a result, they have long sentences with many commas.
I'm curious whether any modern texts could be incorporated. Doing so could improve the model's accuracy.

While preparing the training data, I've observed that the word "hello" is rather uncommon. It isn't
even included in the list of the 10,000 most common words! I expect "hello" to be more common in spoken text, which is one of the
things this project will be applied to. In addition to "hello", there's also "program", "computer", "phone", and "internet". Here's a
sentence that uses some of them: "My computer and phone can both access the internet".

and Jabberwocky. Does it convert them correctly?

How about conjunctions? This is in the training data, so I'm including the conjunctions in sentences. This paragraph has a few: Haven't
you punctuated this sentence? She'll punctuate this sentence. They'll do something. I'm editing this file with a text editor. It's
adding the letters I type to the screen.

Though not present in much of the training data, common abbreviations should also be handled. Here are some: CPU, TPU, USA, EU, IRS, SEC, JS, TS, and RNN. The last one, RNN, stands for "Recurrent Neural Network".

On the topic of training data, many of the documents incorporated thus far are very old. As a result, they have long sentences with many commas.
I'm curious whether any modern texts could be incorporated. Doing so could improve the model's accuracy.

While preparing the training data, I've observed that the word "hello" is rather uncommon. It isn't
even included in the list of the 10,000 most common words! I expect "hello" to be more common in spoken text, which is one of the
things this project will be applied to. In addition to "hello", there's also "program", "computer", "phone", and "internet". Here's a
sentence that uses some of them: "My computer and phone can both access the internet".

Above, I've repeated "hello" a few times, so it is likely to now be included in the vocabulary. However, there may be
similar words that don't appear frequently in the training data. As such, while designing the model, we should be sure that
unknown words (like "hello") are preserved.

It would also be nice if "Joplin" was common enough to be included in the model's vocabulary. This would help ensure that the
model knows to properly capitalize it. I'm listing "Joplin" several times here as part of an effort to make this happen:
Joplin Desktop, Joplin Mobile, Joplin CLI, Joplin Web, Joplin's documentation, Joplin notebook, Joplin note, Joplin's editor, Joplin,
and Joplin.

Before deploying the model, it will be important to check for bias caused by its training data. For example, are certain pronouns and
honorifics over represented in the training data? Will the model understand "Mr. Name" but not "Ms. Name"?

I'm repeating the above text to emphasize it in the training data. This should offset some of the other sources, but runs the risk of
biasing the model towards my own writing.

This document's goal is to provide a small amount of additional data for fine-tuning the model.

Rationale: The majority of the model's data is from the 1800s and early 1900s. As such, the
lexicon and grammar employed by the model are somewhat archaic (to-do: find an archaic synonym
for "somewhat").

For example, the model should be able to employ the term "Joplin" in various forms. E.g. by reading
"Joplin's GUI differs significantly between its React Native Android app and its Windows app" and
inserting punctuation appropriately.

Unfortunately, this file is likely to have little or no effect: It's very short compared to the other
documents in the training corpus, it only mentions the relevant terms a few times, and may occasionally
be included in the validation set, rather than the training set.

Here's the main text of the document:

Joplin is a note-taking and to-do application that supports Windows, Linux, iOS, Android, web, and other platforms.
Its iOS, Android, and web platforms were written using React Native. Its Windows, Linux, and MacOS apps
use Electron.

Electron is an interesting word. Usually, it's lowercase (e.g. "electron"). However, in some cases, it
should be uppercase (e.g. "Electron"). I'm curious - will the model be intelligent enough to recognize,
from context, which "electron" is being referred to?

I'm also curious how well the model will handle question punctuation. Will it be different in English and
French? The same? It's hard to say.

Here are a few sample questions:

Why is this program not working? Why are my sentences not properly punctuated? Why doesn't it properly punctuate the word "I'm"?

Unfortunately, this file is likely to have little or no effect: It's very short compared to the other
documents in the training corpus, it only mentions the relevant terms a few times, and may occasionally
be included in the validation set, rather than the training set.

Here's the main text of the document:

Joplin is a note-taking and to-do application that supports Windows, Linux, iOS, Android, web, and other platforms.
Its iOS, Android, and web platforms were written using React Native. Its Windows, Linux, and MacOS apps
use Electron.

Electron is an interesting word. Usually, it's lowercase (e.g. "electron"). However, in some cases, it
should be uppercase (e.g. "Electron"). I'm curious - will the model be intelligent enough to recognize,
from context, which "electron" is being referred to?

I'm also curious how well the model will handle question punctuation. Will it be different in English and
French? The same? It's hard to say.

Here are a few sample questions:

Why is this program not working? Why are my sentences not properly punctuated? Why doesn't it properly punctuate the word "I'm"?

I am testing this application. Does it work?

What about names? Are names capitalized correctly? These are names: Bob, Canada, Greenland, Eve, Edward, Alice,
and Jabberwocky. Does it convert them correctly?

How about conjunctions? This is in the training data, so I'm including the conjunctions in sentences. This paragraph has a few: Haven't
you punctuated this sentence? She'll punctuate this sentence. They'll do something. I'm editing this file with a text editor. It's
adding the letters I type to the screen.

Though not present in much of the training data, common abbreviations should also be handled. Here are some: CPU, TPU, USA, EU, IRS, SEC, JS, TS, and RNN. The last one, RNN, stands for "Recurrent Neural Network".

On the topic of training data, many of the documents incorporated thus far are very old. As a result, they have long sentences with many commas.
I'm curious whether any modern texts could be incorporated. Doing so could improve the model's accuracy.

While preparing the training data, I've observed that the word "hello" is rather uncommon. It isn't
even included in the list of the 10,000 most common words! I expect "hello" to be more common in spoken text, which is one of the
things this project will be applied to. In addition to "hello", there's also "program", "computer", "phone", and "internet". Here's a
sentence that uses some of them: "My computer and phone can both access the internet".

Above, I've repeated "hello" a few times, so it is likely to now be included in the vocabulary. However, there may be
similar words that don't appear frequently in the training data. As such, while designing the model, we should be sure that
unknown words (like "hello") are preserved.

It would also be nice if "Joplin" was common enough to be included in the model's vocabulary. This would help ensure that the
model knows to properly capitalize it. I'm listing "Joplin" several times here as part of an effort to make this happen:
Joplin Desktop, Joplin Mobile, Joplin CLI, Joplin Web, Joplin's documentation, Joplin notebook, Joplin note, Joplin's editor, Joplin,
and Joplin.

Before deploying the model, it will be important to check for bias caused by its training data. For example, are certain pronouns and
honorifics over represented in the training data? Will the model understand "Mr. Name" but not "Ms. Name"?

I'm repeating the above text to emphasize it in the training data. This should offset some of the other sources, but runs the risk of
biasing the model towards my own writing.

This document's goal is to provide a small amount of additional data for fine-tuning the model.

Rationale: The majority of the model's data is from the 1800s and early 1900s. As such, the
lexicon and grammar employed by the model are somewhat archaic (to-do: find an archaic synonym
for "somewhat").

For example, the model should be able to employ the term "Joplin" in various forms. E.g. by reading
"Joplin's GUI differs significantly between its React Native Android app and its Windows app" and
inserting punctuation appropriately.

model knows to properly capitalize it. I'm listing "Joplin" several times here as part of an effort to make this happen:
Joplin Desktop, Joplin Mobile, Joplin CLI, Joplin Web, Joplin's documentation, Joplin notebook, Joplin note, Joplin's editor, Joplin,
and Joplin.

Before deploying the model, it will be important to check for bias caused by its training data. For example, are certain pronouns and
honorifics over represented in the training data? Will the model understand "Mr. Name" but not "Ms. Name"?

I'm repeating the above text to emphasize it in the training data. This should offset some of the other sources, but runs the risk of
biasing the model towards my own writing.

This document's goal is to provide a small amount of additional data for fine-tuning the model.

Rationale: The majority of the model's data is from the 1800s and early 1900s. As such, the
lexicon and grammar employed by the model are somewhat archaic (to-do: find an archaic synonym
for "somewhat").

For example, the model should be able to employ the term "Joplin" in various forms. E.g. by reading
"Joplin's GUI differs significantly between its React Native Android app and its Windows app" and
inserting punctuation appropriately.

Unfortunately, this file is likely to have little or no effect: It's very short compared to the other
documents in the training corpus, it only mentions the relevant terms a few times, and may occasionally
be included in the validation set, rather than the training set.

Here's the main text of the document:

Joplin is a note-taking and to-do application that supports Windows, Linux, iOS, Android, web, and other platforms.
Its iOS, Android, and web platforms were written using React Native. Its Windows, Linux, and MacOS apps
use Electron.

Electron is an interesting word. Usually, it's lowercase (e.g. "electron"). However, in some cases, it
should be uppercase (e.g. "Electron"). I'm curious - will the model be intelligent enough to recognize,
from context, which "electron" is being referred to?

I'm also curious how well the model will handle question punctuation. Will it be different in English and
French? The same? It's hard to say.

Here are a few sample questions:

Why is this program not working? Why are my sentences not properly punctuated? Why doesn't it properly punctuate the word "I'm"?

I am testing this application. Does it work?

What about names? Are names capitalized correctly? These are names: Bob, Canada, Greenland, Eve, Edward, Alice,
and Jabberwocky. Does it convert them correctly?

How about conjunctions? This is in the training data, so I'm including the conjunctions in sentences. This paragraph has a few: Haven't
you punctuated this sentence? She'll punctuate this sentence. They'll do something. I'm editing this file with a text editor. It's
adding the letters I type to the screen.

Though not present in much of the training data, common abbreviations should also be handled. Here are some: CPU, TPU, USA, EU, IRS, SEC, JS, TS, and RNN. The last one, RNN, stands for "Recurrent Neural Network".

On the topic of training data, many of the documents incorporated thus far are very old. As a result, they have long sentences with many commas.
I'm curious whether any modern texts could be incorporated. Doing so could improve the model's accuracy.

While preparing the training data, I've observed that the word "hello" is rather uncommon. It isn't
even included in the list of the 10,000 most common words! I expect "hello" to be more common in spoken text, which is one of the
things this project will be applied to. In addition to "hello", there's also "program", "computer", "phone", and "internet". Here's a
sentence that uses some of them: "My computer and phone can both access the internet".

Above, I've repeated "hello" a few times, so it is likely to now be included in the vocabulary. However, there may be
similar words that don't appear frequently in the training data. As such, while designing the model, we should be sure that
unknown words (like "hello") are preserved.

Though not present in much of the training data, common abbreviations should also be handled. Here are some: CPU, TPU, USA, EU, IRS, SEC, JS, TS, and RNN. The last one, RNN, stands for "Recurrent Neural Network".

On the topic of training data, many of the documents incorporated thus far are very old. As a result, they have long sentences with many commas.
I'm curious whether any modern texts could be incorporated. Doing so could improve the model's accuracy.

While preparing the training data, I've observed that the word "hello" is rather uncommon. It isn't
even included in the list of the 10,000 most common words! I expect "hello" to be more common in spoken text, which is one of the
things this project will be applied to. In addition to "hello", there's also "program", "computer", "phone", and "internet". Here's a
sentence that uses some of them: "My computer and phone can both access the internet".

Above, I've repeated "hello" a few times, so it is likely to now be included in the vocabulary. However, there may be
similar words that don't appear frequently in the training data. As such, while designing the model, we should be sure that
unknown words (like "hello") are preserved.

It would also be nice if "Joplin" was common enough to be included in the model's vocabulary. This would help ensure that the
model knows to properly capitalize it. I'm listing "Joplin" several times here as part of an effort to make this happen:
Joplin Desktop, Joplin Mobile, Joplin CLI, Joplin Web, Joplin's documentation, Joplin notebook, Joplin note, Joplin's editor, Joplin,
and Joplin.

Before deploying the model, it will be important to check for bias caused by its training data. For example, are certain pronouns and
honorifics over represented in the training data? Will the model understand "Mr. Name" but not "Ms. Name"?

I'm repeating the above text to emphasize it in the training data. This should offset some of the other sources, but runs the risk of
biasing the model towards my own writing.

This document's goal is to provide a small amount of additional data for fine-tuning the model.

Rationale: The majority of the model's data is from the 1800s and early 1900s. As such, the
lexicon and grammar employed by the model are somewhat archaic (to-do: find an archaic synonym
for "somewhat").

For example, the model should be able to employ the term "Joplin" in various forms. E.g. by reading
"Joplin's GUI differs significantly between its React Native Android app and its Windows app" and
inserting punctuation appropriately.

Unfortunately, this file is likely to have little or no effect: It's very short compared to the other
documents in the training corpus, it only mentions the relevant terms a few times, and may occasionally
be included in the validation set, rather than the training set.

Here's the main text of the document:

Joplin is a note-taking and to-do application that supports Windows, Linux, iOS, Android, web, and other platforms.
Its iOS, Android, and web platforms were written using React Native. Its Windows, Linux, and MacOS apps
use Electron.

Electron is an interesting word. Usually, it's lowercase (e.g. "electron"). However, in some cases, it
should be uppercase (e.g. "Electron"). I'm curious - will the model be intelligent enough to recognize,
from context, which "electron" is being referred to?

I'm also curious how well the model will handle question punctuation. Will it be different in English and
French? The same? It's hard to say.

Here are a few sample questions:

Why is this program not working? Why are my sentences not properly punctuated? Why doesn't it properly punctuate the word "I'm"?

I am testing this application. Does it work?

What about names? Are names capitalized correctly? These are names: Bob, Canada, Greenland, Eve, Edward, Alice,
and Jabberwocky. Does it convert them correctly?

How about conjunctions? This is in the training data, so I'm including the conjunctions in sentences. This paragraph has a few: Haven't

Its iOS, Android, and web platforms were written using React Native. Its Windows, Linux, and MacOS apps
use Electron.

Electron is an interesting word. Usually, it's lowercase (e.g. "electron"). However, in some cases, it
should be uppercase (e.g. "Electron"). I'm curious - will the model be intelligent enough to recognize,
from context, which "electron" is being referred to?

I'm also curious how well the model will handle question punctuation. Will it be different in English and
French? The same? It's hard to say.

Here are a few sample questions:

Why is this program not working? Why are my sentences not properly punctuated? Why doesn't it properly punctuate the word "I'm"?

I am testing this application. Does it work?

What about names? Are names capitalized correctly? These are names: Bob, Canada, Greenland, Eve, Edward, Alice,
and Jabberwocky. Does it convert them correctly?

How about conjunctions? This is in the training data, so I'm including the conjunctions in sentences. This paragraph has a few: Haven't
you punctuated this sentence? She'll punctuate this sentence. They'll do something. I'm editing this file with a text editor. It's
adding the letters I type to the screen.

Though not present in much of the training data, common abbreviations should also be handled. Here are some: CPU, TPU, USA, EU, IRS, SEC, JS, TS, and RNN. The last one, RNN, stands for "Recurrent Neural Network".

On the topic of training data, many of the documents incorporated thus far are very old. As a result, they have long sentences with many commas.
I'm curious whether any modern texts could be incorporated. Doing so could improve the model's accuracy.

While preparing the training data, I've observed that the word "hello" is rather uncommon. It isn't
even included in the list of the 10,000 most common words! I expect "hello" to be more common in spoken text, which is one of the
things this project will be applied to. In addition to "hello", there's also "program", "computer", "phone", and "internet". Here's a
sentence that uses some of them: "My computer and phone can both access the internet".

Above, I've repeated "hello" a few times, so it is likely to now be included in the vocabulary. However, there may be
similar words that don't appear frequently in the training data. As such, while designing the model, we should be sure that
unknown words (like "hello") are preserved.

It would also be nice if "Joplin" was common enough to be included in the model's vocabulary. This would help ensure that the
model knows to properly capitalize it. I'm listing "Joplin" several times here as part of an effort to make this happen:
Joplin Desktop, Joplin Mobile, Joplin CLI, Joplin Web, Joplin's documentation, Joplin notebook, Joplin note, Joplin's editor, Joplin,
and Joplin.

Before deploying the model, it will be important to check for bias caused by its training data. For example, are certain pronouns and
honorifics over represented in the training data? Will the model understand "Mr. Name" but not "Ms. Name"?

I'm repeating the above text to emphasize it in the training data. This should offset some of the other sources, but runs the risk of
biasing the model towards my own writing.

This document's goal is to provide a small amount of additional data for fine-tuning the model.

Rationale: The majority of the model's data is from the 1800s and early 1900s. As such, the
lexicon and grammar employed by the model are somewhat archaic (to-do: find an archaic synonym
for "somewhat").

For example, the model should be able to employ the term "Joplin" in various forms. E.g. by reading
"Joplin's GUI differs significantly between its React Native Android app and its Windows app" and
inserting punctuation appropriately.

Unfortunately, this file is likely to have little or no effect: It's very short compared to the other
documents in the training corpus, it only mentions the relevant terms a few times, and may occasionally
be included in the validation set, rather than the training set.

honorifics over represented in the training data? Will the model understand "Mr. Name" but not "Ms. Name"?

I'm repeating the above text to emphasize it in the training data. This should offset some of the other sources, but runs the risk of
biasing the model towards my own writing.

This document's goal is to provide a small amount of additional data for fine-tuning the model.

Rationale: The majority of the model's data is from the 1800s and early 1900s. As such, the
lexicon and grammar employed by the model are somewhat archaic (to-do: find an archaic synonym
for "somewhat").

For example, the model should be able to employ the term "Joplin" in various forms. E.g. by reading
"Joplin's GUI differs significantly between its React Native Android app and its Windows app" and
inserting punctuation appropriately.

Unfortunately, this file is likely to have little or no effect: It's very short compared to the other
documents in the training corpus, it only mentions the relevant terms a few times, and may occasionally
be included in the validation set, rather than the training set.

Here's the main text of the document:

Joplin is a note-taking and to-do application that supports Windows, Linux, iOS, Android, web, and other platforms.
Its iOS, Android, and web platforms were written using React Native. Its Windows, Linux, and MacOS apps
use Electron.

Electron is an interesting word. Usually, it's lowercase (e.g. "electron"). However, in some cases, it
should be uppercase (e.g. "Electron"). I'm curious - will the model be intelligent enough to recognize,
from context, which "electron" is being referred to?

I'm also curious how well the model will handle question punctuation. Will it be different in English and
French? The same? It's hard to say.

Here are a few sample questions:

Why is this program not working? Why are my sentences not properly punctuated? Why doesn't it properly punctuate the word "I'm"?

I am testing this application. Does it work?

What about names? Are names capitalized correctly? These are names: Bob, Canada, Greenland, Eve, Edward, Alice,
and Jabberwocky. Does it convert them correctly?

How about conjunctions? This is in the training data, so I'm including the conjunctions in sentences. This paragraph has a few: Haven't
you punctuated this sentence? She'll punctuate this sentence. They'll do something. I'm editing this file with a text editor. It's
adding the letters I type to the screen.

Though not present in much of the training data, common abbreviations should also be handled. Here are some: CPU, TPU, USA, EU, IRS, SEC, JS, TS, and RNN. The last one, RNN, stands for "Recurrent Neural Network".

On the topic of training data, many of the documents incorporated thus far are very old. As a result, they have long sentences with many commas.
I'm curious whether any modern texts could be incorporated. Doing so could improve the model's accuracy.

While preparing the training data, I've observed that the word "hello" is rather uncommon. It isn't
even included in the list of the 10,000 most common words! I expect "hello" to be more common in spoken text, which is one of the
things this project will be applied to. In addition to "hello", there's also "program", "computer", "phone", and "internet". Here's a
sentence that uses some of them: "My computer and phone can both access the internet".

Above, I've repeated "hello" a few times, so it is likely to now be included in the vocabulary. However, there may be
similar words that don't appear frequently in the training data. As such, while designing the model, we should be sure that
unknown words (like "hello") are preserved.

It would also be nice if "Joplin" was common enough to be included in the model's vocabulary. This would help ensure that the
model knows to properly capitalize it. I'm listing "Joplin" several times here as part of an effort to make this happen:
Joplin Desktop, Joplin Mobile, Joplin CLI, Joplin Web, Joplin's documentation, Joplin notebook, Joplin note, Joplin's editor, Joplin,

even included in the list of the 10,000 most common words! I expect "hello" to be more common in spoken text, which is one of the
things this project will be applied to. In addition to "hello", there's also "program", "computer", "phone", and "internet". Here's a
sentence that uses some of them: "My computer and phone can both access the internet".

Above, I've repeated "hello" a few times, so it is likely to now be included in the vocabulary. However, there may be
similar words that don't appear frequently in the training data. As such, while designing the model, we should be sure that
unknown words (like "hello") are preserved.

It would also be nice if "Joplin" was common enough to be included in the model's vocabulary. This would help ensure that the
model knows to properly capitalize it. I'm listing "Joplin" several times here as part of an effort to make this happen:
Joplin Desktop, Joplin Mobile, Joplin CLI, Joplin Web, Joplin's documentation, Joplin notebook, Joplin note, Joplin's editor, Joplin,
and Joplin.

Before deploying the model, it will be important to check for bias caused by its training data. For example, are certain pronouns and
honorifics over represented in the training data? Will the model understand "Mr. Name" but not "Ms. Name"?

I'm repeating the above text to emphasize it in the training data. This should offset some of the other sources, but runs the risk of
biasing the model towards my own writing.

This document's goal is to provide a small amount of additional data for fine-tuning the model.

Rationale: The majority of the model's data is from the 1800s and early 1900s. As such, the
lexicon and grammar employed by the model are somewhat archaic (to-do: find an archaic synonym
for "somewhat").

For example, the model should be able to employ the term "Joplin" in various forms. E.g. by reading
"Joplin's GUI differs significantly between its React Native Android app and its Windows app" and
inserting punctuation appropriately.

Unfortunately, this file is likely to have little or no effect: It's very short compared to the other
documents in the training corpus, it only mentions the relevant terms a few times, and may occasionally
be included in the validation set, rather than the training set.

Here's the main text of the document:

Joplin is a note-taking and to-do application that supports Windows, Linux, iOS, Android, web, and other platforms.
Its iOS, Android, and web platforms were written using React Native. Its Windows, Linux, and MacOS apps
use Electron.

Electron is an interesting word. Usually, it's lowercase (e.g. "electron"). However, in some cases, it
should be uppercase (e.g. "Electron"). I'm curious - will the model be intelligent enough to recognize,
from context, which "electron" is being referred to?

I'm also curious how well the model will handle question punctuation. Will it be different in English and
French? The same? It's hard to say.

Here are a few sample questions:

Why is this program not working? Why are my sentences not properly punctuated? Why doesn't it properly punctuate the word "I'm"?

I am testing this application. Does it work?

What about names? Are names capitalized correctly? These are names: Bob, Canada, Greenland, Eve, Edward, Alice,
and Jabberwocky. Does it convert them correctly?

How about conjunctions? This is in the training data, so I'm including the conjunctions in sentences. This paragraph has a few: Haven't
you punctuated this sentence? She'll punctuate this sentence. They'll do something. I'm editing this file with a text editor. It's
adding the letters I type to the screen.

Though not present in much of the training data, common abbreviations should also be handled. Here are some: CPU, TPU, USA, EU, IRS, SEC, JS, TS, and RNN. The last one, RNN, stands for "Recurrent Neural Network".

On the topic of training data, many of the documents incorporated thus far are very old. As a result, they have long sentences with many commas.

Here are a few sample questions:

Why is this program not working? Why are my sentences not properly punctuated? Why doesn't it properly punctuate the word "I'm"?

I am testing this application. Does it work?

What about names? Are names capitalized correctly? These are names: Bob, Canada, Greenland, Eve, Edward, Alice,
and Jabberwocky. Does it convert them correctly?

How about conjunctions? This is in the training data, so I'm including the conjunctions in sentences. This paragraph has a few: Haven't
you punctuated this sentence? She'll punctuate this sentence. They'll do something. I'm editing this file with a text editor. It's
adding the letters I type to the screen.

Though not present in much of the training data, common abbreviations should also be handled. Here are some: CPU, TPU, USA, EU, IRS, SEC, JS, TS, and RNN. The last one, RNN, stands for "Recurrent Neural Network".

On the topic of training data, many of the documents incorporated thus far are very old. As a result, they have long sentences with many commas.
I'm curious whether any modern texts could be incorporated. Doing so could improve the model's accuracy.

While preparing the training data, I've observed that the word "hello" is rather uncommon. It isn't
even included in the list of the 10,000 most common words! I expect "hello" to be more common in spoken text, which is one of the
things this project will be applied to. In addition to "hello", there's also "program", "computer", "phone", and "internet". Here's a
sentence that uses some of them: "My computer and phone can both access the internet".

Above, I've repeated "hello" a few times, so it is likely to now be included in the vocabulary. However, there may be
similar words that don't appear frequently in the training data. As such, while designing the model, we should be sure that
unknown words (like "hello") are preserved.

It would also be nice if "Joplin" was common enough to be included in the model's vocabulary. This would help ensure that the
model knows to properly capitalize it. I'm listing "Joplin" several times here as part of an effort to make this happen:
Joplin Desktop, Joplin Mobile, Joplin CLI, Joplin Web, Joplin's documentation, Joplin notebook, Joplin note, Joplin's editor, Joplin,
and Joplin.

Before deploying the model, it will be important to check for bias caused by its training data. For example, are certain pronouns and
honorifics over represented in the training data? Will the model understand "Mr. Name" but not "Ms. Name"?

I'm repeating the above text to emphasize it in the training data. This should offset some of the other sources, but runs the risk of
biasing the model towards my own writing.

This document's goal is to provide a small amount of additional data for fine-tuning the model.

Rationale: The majority of the model's data is from the 1800s and early 1900s. As such, the
lexicon and grammar employed by the model are somewhat archaic (to-do: find an archaic synonym
for "somewhat").

For example, the model should be able to employ the term "Joplin" in various forms. E.g. by reading
"Joplin's GUI differs significantly between its React Native Android app and its Windows app" and
inserting punctuation appropriately.

Unfortunately, this file is likely to have little or no effect: It's very short compared to the other
documents in the training corpus, it only mentions the relevant terms a few times, and may occasionally
be included in the validation set, rather than the training set.

Here's the main text of the document:

Joplin is a note-taking and to-do application that supports Windows, Linux, iOS, Android, web, and other platforms.

use Electron.

Electron is an interesting word. Usually, it's lowercase (e.g. "electron"). However, in some cases, it
should be uppercase (e.g. "Electron"). I'm curious - will the model be intelligent enough to recognize,
from context, which "electron" is being referred to?

For example, the model should be able to employ the term "Joplin" in various forms. E.g. by reading
"Joplin's GUI differs significantly between its React Native Android app and its Windows app" and
inserting punctuation appropriately.

Unfortunately, this file is likely to have little or no effect: It's very short compared to the other
documents in the training corpus, it only mentions the relevant terms a few times, and may occasionally
be included in the validation set, rather than the training set.

Here's the main text of the document:

Joplin is a note-taking and to-do application that supports Windows, Linux, iOS, Android, web, and other platforms.
Its iOS, Android, and web platforms were written using React Native. Its Windows, Linux, and MacOS apps
use Electron.

Electron is an interesting word. Usually, it's lowercase (e.g. "electron"). However, in some cases, it
should be uppercase (e.g. "Electron"). I'm curious - will the model be intelligent enough to recognize,
from context, which "electron" is being referred to?

I'm also curious how well the model will handle question punctuation. Will it be different in English and
French? The same? It's hard to say.

Here are a few sample questions:

Why is this program not working? Why are my sentences not properly punctuated? Why doesn't it properly punctuate the word "I'm"?

I am testing this application. Does it work?

What about names? Are names capitalized correctly? These are names: Bob, Canada, Greenland, Eve, Edward, Alice,
and Jabberwocky. Does it convert them correctly?

How about conjunctions? This is in the training data, so I'm including the conjunctions in sentences. This paragraph has a few: Haven't
you punctuated this sentence? She'll punctuate this sentence. They'll do something. I'm editing this file with a text editor. It's
adding the letters I type to the screen.

Though not present in much of the training data, common abbreviations should also be handled. Here are some: CPU, TPU, USA, EU, IRS, SEC, JS, TS, and RNN. The last one, RNN, stands for "Recurrent Neural Network".

On the topic of training data, many of the documents incorporated thus far are very old. As a result, they have long sentences with many commas.
I'm curious whether any modern texts could be incorporated. Doing so could improve the model's accuracy.

While preparing the training data, I've observed that the word "hello" is rather uncommon. It isn't
even included in the list of the 10,000 most common words! I expect "hello" to be more common in spoken text, which is one of the
things this project will be applied to. In addition to "hello", there's also "program", "computer", "phone", and "internet". Here's a
sentence that uses some of them: "My computer and phone can both access the internet".

Above, I've repeated "hello" a few times, so it is likely to now be included in the vocabulary. However, there may be
similar words that don't appear frequently in the training data. As such, while designing the model, we should be sure that
unknown words (like "hello") are preserved.

It would also be nice if "Joplin" was common enough to be included in the model's vocabulary. This would help ensure that the
model knows to properly capitalize it. I'm listing "Joplin" several times here as part of an effort to make this happen:
Joplin Desktop, Joplin Mobile, Joplin CLI, Joplin Web, Joplin's documentation, Joplin notebook, Joplin note, Joplin's editor, Joplin,
and Joplin.

Before deploying the model, it will be important to check for bias caused by its training data. For example, are certain pronouns and
honorifics over represented in the training data? Will the model understand "Mr. Name" but not "Ms. Name"?

I'm repeating the above text to emphasize it in the training data. This should offset some of the other sources, but runs the risk of
biasing the model towards my own writing.

This document's goal is to provide a small amount of additional data for fine-tuning the model.

Rationale: The majority of the model's data is from the 1800s and early 1900s. As such, the
lexicon and grammar employed by the model are somewhat archaic (to-do: find an archaic synonym
for "somewhat").

unknown words (like "hello") are preserved.

It would also be nice if "Joplin" was common enough to be included in the model's vocabulary. This would help ensure that the
model knows to properly capitalize it. I'm listing "Joplin" several times here as part of an effort to make this happen:
Joplin Desktop, Joplin Mobile, Joplin CLI, Joplin Web, Joplin's documentation, Joplin notebook, Joplin note, Joplin's editor, Joplin,
and Joplin.

Before deploying the model, it will be important to check for bias caused by its training data. For example, are certain pronouns and
honorifics over represented in the training data? Will the model understand "Mr. Name" but not "Ms. Name"?

I'm repeating the above text to emphasize it in the training data. This should offset some of the other sources, but runs the risk of
biasing the model towards my own writing.

This document's goal is to provide a small amount of additional data for fine-tuning the model.

Rationale: The majority of the model's data is from the 1800s and early 1900s. As such, the
lexicon and grammar employed by the model are somewhat archaic (to-do: find an archaic synonym
for "somewhat").

For example, the model should be able to employ the term "Joplin" in various forms. E.g. by reading
"Joplin's GUI differs significantly between its React Native Android app and its Windows app" and
inserting punctuation appropriately.

Unfortunately, this file is likely to have little or no effect: It's very short compared to the other
documents in the training corpus, it only mentions the relevant terms a few times, and may occasionally
be included in the validation set, rather than the training set.

Here's the main text of the document:

Joplin is a note-taking and to-do application that supports Windows, Linux, iOS, Android, web, and other platforms.
Its iOS, Android, and web platforms were written using React Native. Its Windows, Linux, and MacOS apps
use Electron.

Electron is an interesting word. Usually, it's lowercase (e.g. "electron"). However, in some cases, it
should be uppercase (e.g. "Electron"). I'm curious - will the model be intelligent enough to recognize,
from context, which "electron" is being referred to?

I'm also curious how well the model will handle question punctuation. Will it be different in English and
French? The same? It's hard to say.

Here are a few sample questions:

Why is this program not working? Why are my sentences not properly punctuated? Why doesn't it properly punctuate the word "I'm"?

I am testing this application. Does it work?

What about names? Are names capitalized correctly? These are names: Bob, Canada, Greenland, Eve, Edward, Alice,
and Jabberwocky. Does it convert them correctly?

How about conjunctions? This is in the training data, so I'm including the conjunctions in sentences. This paragraph has a few: Haven't
you punctuated this sentence? She'll punctuate this sentence. They'll do something. I'm editing this file with a text editor. It's
adding the letters I type to the screen.

Though not present in much of the training data, common abbreviations should also be handled. Here are some: CPU, TPU, USA, EU, IRS, SEC, JS, TS, and RNN. The last one, RNN, stands for "Recurrent Neural Network".

On the topic of training data, many of the documents incorporated thus far are very old. As a result, they have long sentences with many commas.
I'm curious whether any modern texts could be incorporated. Doing so could improve the model's accuracy.

While preparing the training data, I've observed that the word "hello" is rather uncommon. It isn't
even included in the list of the 10,000 most common words! I expect "hello" to be more common in spoken text, which is one of the
things this project will be applied to. In addition to "hello", there's also "program", "computer", "phone", and "internet". Here's a
sentence that uses some of them: "My computer and phone can both access the internet".

Above, I've repeated "hello" a few times, so it is likely to now be included in the vocabulary. However, there may be

you punctuated this sentence? She'll punctuate this sentence. They'll do something. I'm editing this file with a text editor. It's
adding the letters I type to the screen.

Though not present in much of the training data, common abbreviations should also be handled. Here are some: CPU, TPU, USA, EU, IRS, SEC, JS, TS, and RNN. The last one, RNN, stands for "Recurrent Neural Network".

On the topic of training data, many of the documents incorporated thus far are very old. As a result, they have long sentences with many commas.
I'm curious whether any modern texts could be incorporated. Doing so could improve the model's accuracy.

While preparing the training data, I've observed that the word "hello" is rather uncommon. It isn't
even included in the list of the 10,000 most common words! I expect "hello" to be more common in spoken text, which is one of the
things this project will be applied to. In addition to "hello", there's also "program", "computer", "phone", and "internet". Here's a
sentence that uses some of them: "My computer and phone can both access the internet".

Above, I've repeated "hello" a few times, so it is likely to now be included in the vocabulary. However, there may be
similar words that don't appear frequently in the training data. As such, while designing the model, we should be sure that
unknown words (like "hello") are preserved.

It would also be nice if "Joplin" was common enough to be included in the model's vocabulary. This would help ensure that the
model knows to properly capitalize it. I'm listing "Joplin" several times here as part of an effort to make this happen:
Joplin Desktop, Joplin Mobile, Joplin CLI, Joplin Web, Joplin's documentation, Joplin notebook, Joplin note, Joplin's editor, Joplin,
and Joplin.

Before deploying the model, it will be important to check for bias caused by its training data. For example, are certain pronouns and
honorifics over represented in the training data? Will the model understand "Mr. Name" but not "Ms. Name"?

I'm repeating the above text to emphasize it in the training data. This should offset some of the other sources, but runs the risk of
biasing the model towards my own writing.

This document's goal is to provide a small amount of additional data for fine-tuning the model.

Rationale: The majority of the model's data is from the 1800s and early 1900s. As such, the
lexicon and grammar employed by the model are somewhat archaic (to-do: find an archaic synonym
for "somewhat").

For example, the model should be able to employ the term "Joplin" in various forms. E.g. by reading
"Joplin's GUI differs significantly between its React Native Android app and its Windows app" and
inserting punctuation appropriately.

Unfortunately, this file is likely to have little or no effect: It's very short compared to the other
documents in the training corpus, it only mentions the relevant terms a few times, and may occasionally
be included in the validation set, rather than the training set.

Here's the main text of the document:

Joplin is a note-taking and to-do application that supports Windows, Linux, iOS, Android, web, and other platforms.
Its iOS, Android, and web platforms were written using React Native. Its Windows, Linux, and MacOS apps
use Electron.

Electron is an interesting word. Usually, it's lowercase (e.g. "electron"). However, in some cases, it
should be uppercase (e.g. "Electron"). I'm curious - will the model be intelligent enough to recognize,
from context, which "electron" is being referred to?

I'm also curious how well the model will handle question punctuation. Will it be different in English and
French? The same? It's hard to say.

Here are a few sample questions:

Why is this program not working? Why are my sentences not properly punctuated? Why doesn't it properly punctuate the word "I'm"?

I am testing this application. Does it work?

What about names? Are names capitalized correctly? These are names: Bob, Canada, Greenland, Eve, Edward, Alice,
and Jabberwocky. Does it convert them correctly?

be included in the validation set, rather than the training set.

Here's the main text of the document:

Joplin is a note-taking and to-do application that supports Windows, Linux, iOS, Android, web, and other platforms.
Its iOS, Android, and web platforms were written using React Native. Its Windows, Linux, and MacOS apps
use Electron.

Electron is an interesting word. Usually, it's lowercase (e.g. "electron"). However, in some cases, it
should be uppercase (e.g. "Electron"). I'm curious - will the model be intelligent enough to recognize,
from context, which "electron" is being referred to?

I'm also curious how well the model will handle question punctuation. Will it be different in English and
French? The same? It's hard to say.

Here are a few sample questions:

Why is this program not working? Why are my sentences not properly punctuated? Why doesn't it properly punctuate the word "I'm"?

I am testing this application. Does it work?

What about names? Are names capitalized correctly? These are names: Bob, Canada, Greenland, Eve, Edward, Alice,
and Jabberwocky. Does it convert them correctly?

How about conjunctions? This is in the training data, so I'm including the conjunctions in sentences. This paragraph has a few: Haven't
you punctuated this sentence? She'll punctuate this sentence. They'll do something. I'm editing this file with a text editor. It's
adding the letters I type to the screen.

Though not present in much of the training data, common abbreviations should also be handled. Here are some: CPU, TPU, USA, EU, IRS, SEC, JS, TS, and RNN. The last one, RNN, stands for "Recurrent Neural Network".

On the topic of training data, many of the documents incorporated thus far are very old. As a result, they have long sentences with many commas.
I'm curious whether any modern texts could be incorporated. Doing so could improve the model's accuracy.

While preparing the training data, I've observed that the word "hello" is rather uncommon. It isn't
even included in the list of the 10,000 most common words! I expect "hello" to be more common in spoken text, which is one of the
things this project will be applied to. In addition to "hello", there's also "program", "computer", "phone", and "internet". Here's a
sentence that uses some of them: "My computer and phone can both access the internet".

Above, I've repeated "hello" a few times, so it is likely to now be included in the vocabulary. However, there may be
similar words that don't appear frequently in the training data. As such, while designing the model, we should be sure that
unknown words (like "hello") are preserved.

It would also be nice if "Joplin" was common enough to be included in the model's vocabulary. This would help ensure that the
model knows to properly capitalize it. I'm listing "Joplin" several times here as part of an effort to make this happen:
Joplin Desktop, Joplin Mobile, Joplin CLI, Joplin Web, Joplin's documentation, Joplin notebook, Joplin note, Joplin's editor, Joplin,
and Joplin.

Before deploying the model, it will be important to check for bias caused by its training data. For example, are certain pronouns and
honorifics over represented in the training data? Will the model understand "Mr. Name" but not "Ms. Name"?

I'm repeating the above text to emphasize it in the training data. This should offset some of the other sources, but runs the risk of
biasing the model towards my own writing.

This document's goal is to provide a small amount of additional data for fine-tuning the model.

Rationale: The majority of the model's data is from the 1800s and early 1900s. As such, the
lexicon and grammar employed by the model are somewhat archaic (to-do: find an archaic synonym
for "somewhat").

For example, the model should be able to employ the term "Joplin" in various forms. E.g. by reading
"Joplin's GUI differs significantly between its React Native Android app and its Windows app" and
inserting punctuation appropriately.

Joplin Desktop, Joplin Mobile, Joplin CLI, Joplin Web, Joplin's documentation, Joplin notebook, Joplin note, Joplin's editor, Joplin,
and Joplin.

Before deploying the model, it will be important to check for bias caused by its training data. For example, are certain pronouns and
honorifics over represented in the training data? Will the model understand "Mr. Name" but not "Ms. Name"?

I'm repeating the above text to emphasize it in the training data. This should offset some of the other sources, but runs the risk of
biasing the model towards my own writing.

This document's goal is to provide a small amount of additional data for fine-tuning the model.

Rationale: The majority of the model's data is from the 1800s and early 1900s. As such, the
lexicon and grammar employed by the model are somewhat archaic (to-do: find an archaic synonym
for "somewhat").

For example, the model should be able to employ the term "Joplin" in various forms. E.g. by reading
"Joplin's GUI differs significantly between its React Native Android app and its Windows app" and
inserting punctuation appropriately.

Unfortunately, this file is likely to have little or no effect: It's very short compared to the other
documents in the training corpus, it only mentions the relevant terms a few times, and may occasionally
be included in the validation set, rather than the training set.

Here's the main text of the document:

Joplin is a note-taking and to-do application that supports Windows, Linux, iOS, Android, web, and other platforms.
Its iOS, Android, and web platforms were written using React Native. Its Windows, Linux, and MacOS apps
use Electron.

Electron is an interesting word. Usually, it's lowercase (e.g. "electron"). However, in some cases, it
should be uppercase (e.g. "Electron"). I'm curious - will the model be intelligent enough to recognize,
from context, which "electron" is being referred to?

I'm also curious how well the model will handle question punctuation. Will it be different in English and
French? The same? It's hard to say.

Here are a few sample questions:

Why is this program not working? Why are my sentences not properly punctuated? Why doesn't it properly punctuate the word "I'm"?

I am testing this application. Does it work?

What about names? Are names capitalized correctly? These are names: Bob, Canada, Greenland, Eve, Edward, Alice,
and Jabberwocky. Does it convert them correctly?

How about conjunctions? This is in the training data, so I'm including the conjunctions in sentences. This paragraph has a few: Haven't
you punctuated this sentence? She'll punctuate this sentence. They'll do something. I'm editing this file with a text editor. It's
adding the letters I type to the screen.

Though not present in much of the training data, common abbreviations should also be handled. Here are some: CPU, TPU, USA, EU, IRS, SEC, JS, TS, and RNN. The last one, RNN, stands for "Recurrent Neural Network".

On the topic of training data, many of the documents incorporated thus far are very old. As a result, they have long sentences with many commas.
I'm curious whether any modern texts could be incorporated. Doing so could improve the model's accuracy.

While preparing the training data, I've observed that the word "hello" is rather uncommon. It isn't
even included in the list of the 10,000 most common words! I expect "hello" to be more common in spoken text, which is one of the
things this project will be applied to. In addition to "hello", there's also "program", "computer", "phone", and "internet". Here's a
sentence that uses some of them: "My computer and phone can both access the internet".

Above, I've repeated "hello" a few times, so it is likely to now be included in the vocabulary. However, there may be
similar words that don't appear frequently in the training data. As such, while designing the model, we should be sure that
unknown words (like "hello") are preserved.

Though not present in much of the training data, common abbreviations should also be handled. Here are some: CPU, TPU, USA, EU, IRS, SEC, JS, TS, and RNN. The last one, RNN, stands for "Recurrent Neural Network".

On the topic of training data, many of the documents incorporated thus far are very old. As a result, they have long sentences with many commas.
I'm curious whether any modern texts could be incorporated. Doing so could improve the model's accuracy.

While preparing the training data, I've observed that the word "hello" is rather uncommon. It isn't
even included in the list of the 10,000 most common words! I expect "hello" to be more common in spoken text, which is one of the
things this project will be applied to. In addition to "hello", there's also "program", "computer", "phone", and "internet". Here's a
sentence that uses some of them: "My computer and phone can both access the internet".

Above, I've repeated "hello" a few times, so it is likely to now be included in the vocabulary. However, there may be
similar words that don't appear frequently in the training data. As such, while designing the model, we should be sure that
unknown words (like "hello") are preserved.

It would also be nice if "Joplin" was common enough to be included in the model's vocabulary. This would help ensure that the
model knows to properly capitalize it. I'm listing "Joplin" several times here as part of an effort to make this happen:
Joplin Desktop, Joplin Mobile, Joplin CLI, Joplin Web, Joplin's documentation, Joplin notebook, Joplin note, Joplin's editor, Joplin,
and Joplin.

Before deploying the model, it will be important to check for bias caused by its training data. For example, are certain pronouns and
honorifics over represented in the training data? Will the model understand "Mr. Name" but not "Ms. Name"?

I'm repeating the above text to emphasize it in the training data. This should offset some of the other sources, but runs the risk of
biasing the model towards my own writing.

This document's goal is to provide a small amount of additional data for fine-tuning the model.

Rationale: The majority of the model's data is from the 1800s and early 1900s. As such, the
lexicon and grammar employed by the model are somewhat archaic (to-do: find an archaic synonym
for "somewhat").

For example, the model should be able to employ the term "Joplin" in various forms. E.g. by reading
"Joplin's GUI differs significantly between its React Native Android app and its Windows app" and
inserting punctuation appropriately.

Unfortunately, this file is likely to have little or no effect: It's very short compared to the other
documents in the training corpus, it only mentions the relevant terms a few times, and may occasionally
be included in the validation set, rather than the training set.

Here's the main text of the document:

Joplin is a note-taking and to-do application that supports Windows, Linux, iOS, Android, web, and other platforms.
Its iOS, Android, and web platforms were written using React Native. Its Windows, Linux, and MacOS apps
use Electron.

Electron is an interesting word. Usually, it's lowercase (e.g. "electron"). However, in some cases, it
should be uppercase (e.g. "Electron"). I'm curious - will the model be intelligent enough to recognize,
from context, which "electron" is being referred to?

I'm also curious how well the model will handle question punctuation. Will it be different in English and
French? The same? It's hard to say.

Here are a few sample questions:

Why is this program not working? Why are my sentences not properly punctuated? Why doesn't it properly punctuate the word "I'm"?

I am testing this application. Does it work?

What about names? Are names capitalized correctly? These are names: Bob, Canada, Greenland, Eve, Edward, Alice,
and Jabberwocky. Does it convert them correctly?

How about conjunctions? This is in the training data, so I'm including the conjunctions in sentences. This paragraph has a few: Haven't

Its iOS, Android, and web platforms were written using React Native. Its Windows, Linux, and MacOS apps
use Electron.

Electron is an interesting word. Usually, it's lowercase (e.g. "electron"). However, in some cases, it
should be uppercase (e.g. "Electron"). I'm curious - will the model be intelligent enough to recognize,
from context, which "electron" is being referred to?

I'm also curious how well the model will handle question punctuation. Will it be different in English and
French? The same? It's hard to say.

Here are a few sample questions:

Why is this program not working? Why are my sentences not properly punctuated? Why doesn't it properly punctuate the word "I'm"?

I am testing this application. Does it work?

What about names? Are names capitalized correctly? These are names: Bob, Canada, Greenland, Eve, Edward, Alice,
and Jabberwocky. Does it convert them correctly?

How about conjunctions? This is in the training data, so I'm including the conjunctions in sentences. This paragraph has a few: Haven't
you punctuated this sentence? She'll punctuate this sentence. They'll do something. I'm editing this file with a text editor. It's
adding the letters I type to the screen.

Though not present in much of the training data, common abbreviations should also be handled. Here are some: CPU, TPU, USA, EU, IRS, SEC, JS, TS, and RNN. The last one, RNN, stands for "Recurrent Neural Network".

On the topic of training data, many of the documents incorporated thus far are very old. As a result, they have long sentences with many commas.
I'm curious whether any modern texts could be incorporated. Doing so could improve the model's accuracy.

While preparing the training data, I've observed that the word "hello" is rather uncommon. It isn't
even included in the list of the 10,000 most common words! I expect "hello" to be more common in spoken text, which is one of the
things this project will be applied to. In addition to "hello", there's also "program", "computer", "phone", and "internet". Here's a
sentence that uses some of them: "My computer and phone can both access the internet".

Above, I've repeated "hello" a few times, so it is likely to now be included in the vocabulary. However, there may be
similar words that don't appear frequently in the training data. As such, while designing the model, we should be sure that
unknown words (like "hello") are preserved.

It would also be nice if "Joplin" was common enough to be included in the model's vocabulary. This would help ensure that the
model knows to properly capitalize it. I'm listing "Joplin" several times here as part of an effort to make this happen:
Joplin Desktop, Joplin Mobile, Joplin CLI, Joplin Web, Joplin's documentation, Joplin notebook, Joplin note, Joplin's editor, Joplin,
and Joplin.

Before deploying the model, it will be important to check for bias caused by its training data. For example, are certain pronouns and
honorifics over represented in the training data? Will the model understand "Mr. Name" but not "Ms. Name"?

I'm repeating the above text to emphasize it in the training data. This should offset some of the other sources, but runs the risk of
biasing the model towards my own writing.

This document's goal is to provide a small amount of additional data for fine-tuning the model.

Rationale: The majority of the model's data is from the 1800s and early 1900s. As such, the
lexicon and grammar employed by the model are somewhat archaic (to-do: find an archaic synonym
for "somewhat").

For example, the model should be able to employ the term "Joplin" in various forms. E.g. by reading
"Joplin's GUI differs significantly between its React Native Android app and its Windows app" and
inserting punctuation appropriately.

Unfortunately, this file is likely to have little or no effect: It's very short compared to the other
documents in the training corpus, it only mentions the relevant terms a few times, and may occasionally
be included in the validation set, rather than the training set.

honorifics over represented in the training data? Will the model understand "Mr. Name" but not "Ms. Name"?

I'm repeating the above text to emphasize it in the training data. This should offset some of the other sources, but runs the risk of
biasing the model towards my own writing.

This document's goal is to provide a small amount of additional data for fine-tuning the model.

Rationale: The majority of the model's data is from the 1800s and early 1900s. As such, the
lexicon and grammar employed by the model are somewhat archaic (to-do: find an archaic synonym
for "somewhat").

For example, the model should be able to employ the term "Joplin" in various forms. E.g. by reading
"Joplin's GUI differs significantly between its React Native Android app and its Windows app" and
inserting punctuation appropriately.

Unfortunately, this file is likely to have little or no effect: It's very short compared to the other
documents in the training corpus, it only mentions the relevant terms a few times, and may occasionally
be included in the validation set, rather than the training set.

Here's the main text of the document:

Joplin is a note-taking and to-do application that supports Windows, Linux, iOS, Android, web, and other platforms.
Its iOS, Android, and web platforms were written using React Native. Its Windows, Linux, and MacOS apps
use Electron.

Electron is an interesting word. Usually, it's lowercase (e.g. "electron"). However, in some cases, it
should be uppercase (e.g. "Electron"). I'm curious - will the model be intelligent enough to recognize,
from context, which "electron" is being referred to?

I'm also curious how well the model will handle question punctuation. Will it be different in English and
French? The same? It's hard to say.

Here are a few sample questions:

Why is this program not working? Why are my sentences not properly punctuated? Why doesn't it properly punctuate the word "I'm"?

I am testing this application. Does it work?

What about names? Are names capitalized correctly? These are names: Bob, Canada, Greenland, Eve, Edward, Alice,
and Jabberwocky. Does it convert them correctly?

How about conjunctions? This is in the training data, so I'm including the conjunctions in sentences. This paragraph has a few: Haven't
you punctuated this sentence? She'll punctuate this sentence. They'll do something. I'm editing this file with a text editor. It's
adding the letters I type to the screen.

Though not present in much of the training data, common abbreviations should also be handled. Here are some: CPU, TPU, USA, EU, IRS, SEC, JS, TS, and RNN. The last one, RNN, stands for "Recurrent Neural Network".

On the topic of training data, many of the documents incorporated thus far are very old. As a result, they have long sentences with many commas.
I'm curious whether any modern texts could be incorporated. Doing so could improve the model's accuracy.

While preparing the training data, I've observed that the word "hello" is rather uncommon. It isn't
even included in the list of the 10,000 most common words! I expect "hello" to be more common in spoken text, which is one of the
things this project will be applied to. In addition to "hello", there's also "program", "computer", "phone", and "internet". Here's a
sentence that uses some of them: "My computer and phone can both access the internet".

Above, I've repeated "hello" a few times, so it is likely to now be included in the vocabulary. However, there may be
similar words that don't appear frequently in the training data. As such, while designing the model, we should be sure that
unknown words (like "hello") are preserved.

It would also be nice if "Joplin" was common enough to be included in the model's vocabulary. This would help ensure that the
model knows to properly capitalize it. I'm listing "Joplin" several times here as part of an effort to make this happen:
Joplin Desktop, Joplin Mobile, Joplin CLI, Joplin Web, Joplin's documentation, Joplin notebook, Joplin note, Joplin's editor, Joplin,

even included in the list of the 10,000 most common words! I expect "hello" to be more common in spoken text, which is one of the
things this project will be applied to. In addition to "hello", there's also "program", "computer", "phone", and "internet". Here's a
sentence that uses some of them: "My computer and phone can both access the internet".

Above, I've repeated "hello" a few times, so it is likely to now be included in the vocabulary. However, there may be
similar words that don't appear frequently in the training data. As such, while designing the model, we should be sure that
unknown words (like "hello") are preserved.

It would also be nice if "Joplin" was common enough to be included in the model's vocabulary. This would help ensure that the
model knows to properly capitalize it. I'm listing "Joplin" several times here as part of an effort to make this happen:
Joplin Desktop, Joplin Mobile, Joplin CLI, Joplin Web, Joplin's documentation, Joplin notebook, Joplin note, Joplin's editor, Joplin,
and Joplin.

Before deploying the model, it will be important to check for bias caused by its training data. For example, are certain pronouns and
honorifics over represented in the training data? Will the model understand "Mr. Name" but not "Ms. Name"?

I'm repeating the above text to emphasize it in the training data. This should offset some of the other sources, but runs the risk of
biasing the model towards my own writing.

This document's goal is to provide a small amount of additional data for fine-tuning the model.

Rationale: The majority of the model's data is from the 1800s and early 1900s. As such, the
lexicon and grammar employed by the model are somewhat archaic (to-do: find an archaic synonym
for "somewhat").

For example, the model should be able to employ the term "Joplin" in various forms. E.g. by reading
"Joplin's GUI differs significantly between its React Native Android app and its Windows app" and
inserting punctuation appropriately.

Unfortunately, this file is likely to have little or no effect: It's very short compared to the other
documents in the training corpus, it only mentions the relevant terms a few times, and may occasionally
be included in the validation set, rather than the training set.

Here's the main text of the document:

Joplin is a note-taking and to-do application that supports Windows, Linux, iOS, Android, web, and other platforms.
Its iOS, Android, and web platforms were written using React Native. Its Windows, Linux, and MacOS apps
use Electron.

Electron is an interesting word. Usually, it's lowercase (e.g. "electron"). However, in some cases, it
should be uppercase (e.g. "Electron"). I'm curious - will the model be intelligent enough to recognize,
from context, which "electron" is being referred to?

I'm also curious how well the model will handle question punctuation. Will it be different in English and
French? The same? It's hard to say.

Here are a few sample questions:

Why is this program not working? Why are my sentences not properly punctuated? Why doesn't it properly punctuate the word "I'm"?

I am testing this application. Does it work?

What about names? Are names capitalized correctly? These are names: Bob, Canada, Greenland, Eve, Edward, Alice,
and Jabberwocky. Does it convert them correctly?

How about conjunctions? This is in the training data, so I'm including the conjunctions in sentences. This paragraph has a few: Haven't
you punctuated this sentence? She'll punctuate this sentence. They'll do something. I'm editing this file with a text editor. It's
adding the letters I type to the screen.

Though not present in much of the training data, common abbreviations should also be handled. Here are some: CPU, TPU, USA, EU, IRS, SEC, JS, TS, and RNN. The last one, RNN, stands for "Recurrent Neural Network".

On the topic of training data, many of the documents incorporated thus far are very old. As a result, they have long sentences with many commas.

Here are a few sample questions:

Why is this program not working? Why are my sentences not properly punctuated? Why doesn't it properly punctuate the word "I'm"?

I am testing this application. Does it work?

What about names? Are names capitalized correctly? These are names: Bob, Canada, Greenland, Eve, Edward, Alice,
and Jabberwocky. Does it convert them correctly?

How about conjunctions? This is in the training data, so I'm including the conjunctions in sentences. This paragraph has a few: Haven't
you punctuated this sentence? She'll punctuate this sentence. They'll do something. I'm editing this file with a text editor. It's
adding the letters I type to the screen.

Though not present in much of the training data, common abbreviations should also be handled. Here are some: CPU, TPU, USA, EU, IRS, SEC, JS, TS, and RNN. The last one, RNN, stands for "Recurrent Neural Network".

On the topic of training data, many of the documents incorporated thus far are very old. As a result, they have long sentences with many commas.
I'm curious whether any modern texts could be incorporated. Doing so could improve the model's accuracy.

While preparing the training data, I've observed that the word "hello" is rather uncommon. It isn't
even included in the list of the 10,000 most common words! I expect "hello" to be more common in spoken text, which is one of the
things this project will be applied to. In addition to "hello", there's also "program", "computer", "phone", and "internet". Here's a
sentence that uses some of them: "My computer and phone can both access the internet".

Above, I've repeated "hello" a few times, so it is likely to now be included in the vocabulary. However, there may be
similar words that don't appear frequently in the training data. As such, while designing the model, we should be sure that
unknown words (like "hello") are preserved.

It would also be nice if "Joplin" was common enough to be included in the model's vocabulary. This would help ensure that the
model knows to properly capitalize it. I'm listing "Joplin" several times here as part of an effort to make this happen:
Joplin Desktop, Joplin Mobile, Joplin CLI, Joplin Web, Joplin's documentation, Joplin notebook, Joplin note, Joplin's editor, Joplin,
and Joplin.

Before deploying the model, it will be important to check for bias caused by its training data. For example, are certain pronouns and
honorifics over represented in the training data? Will the model understand "Mr. Name" but not "Ms. Name"?

I'm repeating the above text to emphasize it in the training data. This should offset some of the other sources, but runs the risk of
biasing the model towards my own writing.

This document's goal is to provide a small amount of additional data for fine-tuning the model.

Rationale: The majority of the model's data is from the 1800s and early 1900s. As such, the
lexicon and grammar employed by the model are somewhat archaic (to-do: find an archaic synonym
for "somewhat").

For example, the model should be able to employ the term "Joplin" in various forms. E.g. by reading
"Joplin's GUI differs significantly between its React Native Android app and its Windows app" and
inserting punctuation appropriately.

Unfortunately, this file is likely to have little or no effect: It's very short compared to the other
documents in the training corpus, it only mentions the relevant terms a few times, and may occasionally
be included in the validation set, rather than the training set.

Here's the main text of the document:

Joplin is a note-taking and to-do application that supports Windows, Linux, iOS, Android, web, and other platforms.

use Electron.

Electron is an interesting word. Usually, it's lowercase (e.g. "electron"). However, in some cases, it
should be uppercase (e.g. "Electron"). I'm curious - will the model be intelligent enough to recognize,
from context, which "electron" is being referred to?

For example, the model should be able to employ the term "Joplin" in various forms. E.g. by reading
"Joplin's GUI differs significantly between its React Native Android app and its Windows app" and
inserting punctuation appropriately.

Unfortunately, this file is likely to have little or no effect: It's very short compared to the other
documents in the training corpus, it only mentions the relevant terms a few times, and may occasionally
be included in the validation set, rather than the training set.

Here's the main text of the document:

Joplin is a note-taking and to-do application that supports Windows, Linux, iOS, Android, web, and other platforms.
Its iOS, Android, and web platforms were written using React Native. Its Windows, Linux, and MacOS apps
use Electron.

Electron is an interesting word. Usually, it's lowercase (e.g. "electron"). However, in some cases, it
should be uppercase (e.g. "Electron"). I'm curious - will the model be intelligent enough to recognize,
from context, which "electron" is being referred to?

I'm also curious how well the model will handle question punctuation. Will it be different in English and
French? The same? It's hard to say.

Here are a few sample questions:

Why is this program not working? Why are my sentences not properly punctuated? Why doesn't it properly punctuate the word "I'm"?

I am testing this application. Does it work?

What about names? Are names capitalized correctly? These are names: Bob, Canada, Greenland, Eve, Edward, Alice,
and Jabberwocky. Does it convert them correctly?

How about conjunctions? This is in the training data, so I'm including the conjunctions in sentences. This paragraph has a few: Haven't
you punctuated this sentence? She'll punctuate this sentence. They'll do something. I'm editing this file with a text editor. It's
adding the letters I type to the screen.

Though not present in much of the training data, common abbreviations should also be handled. Here are some: CPU, TPU, USA, EU, IRS, SEC, JS, TS, and RNN. The last one, RNN, stands for "Recurrent Neural Network".

On the topic of training data, many of the documents incorporated thus far are very old. As a result, they have long sentences with many commas.
I'm curious whether any modern texts could be incorporated. Doing so could improve the model's accuracy.

While preparing the training data, I've observed that the word "hello" is rather uncommon. It isn't
even included in the list of the 10,000 most common words! I expect "hello" to be more common in spoken text, which is one of the
things this project will be applied to. In addition to "hello", there's also "program", "computer", "phone", and "internet". Here's a
sentence that uses some of them: "My computer and phone can both access the internet".

Above, I've repeated "hello" a few times, so it is likely to now be included in the vocabulary. However, there may be
similar words that don't appear frequently in the training data. As such, while designing the model, we should be sure that
unknown words (like "hello") are preserved.

It would also be nice if "Joplin" was common enough to be included in the model's vocabulary. This would help ensure that the
model knows to properly capitalize it. I'm listing "Joplin" several times here as part of an effort to make this happen:
Joplin Desktop, Joplin Mobile, Joplin CLI, Joplin Web, Joplin's documentation, Joplin notebook, Joplin note, Joplin's editor, Joplin,
and Joplin.

Before deploying the model, it will be important to check for bias caused by its training data. For example, are certain pronouns and
honorifics over represented in the training data? Will the model understand "Mr. Name" but not "Ms. Name"?

I'm repeating the above text to emphasize it in the training data. This should offset some of the other sources, but runs the risk of
biasing the model towards my own writing.

This document's goal is to provide a small amount of additional data for fine-tuning the model.

Rationale: The majority of the model's data is from the 1800s and early 1900s. As such, the
lexicon and grammar employed by the model are somewhat archaic (to-do: find an archaic synonym
for "somewhat").

unknown words (like "hello") are preserved.

It would also be nice if "Joplin" was common enough to be included in the model's vocabulary. This would help ensure that the
model knows to properly capitalize it. I'm listing "Joplin" several times here as part of an effort to make this happen:
Joplin Desktop, Joplin Mobile, Joplin CLI, Joplin Web, Joplin's documentation, Joplin notebook, Joplin note, Joplin's editor, Joplin,
and Joplin.

Before deploying the model, it will be important to check for bias caused by its training data. For example, are certain pronouns and
honorifics over represented in the training data? Will the model understand "Mr. Name" but not "Ms. Name"?

I'm repeating the above text to emphasize it in the training data. This should offset some of the other sources, but runs the risk of
biasing the model towards my own writing.

This document's goal is to provide a small amount of additional data for fine-tuning the model.

Rationale: The majority of the model's data is from the 1800s and early 1900s. As such, the
lexicon and grammar employed by the model are somewhat archaic (to-do: find an archaic synonym
for "somewhat").

For example, the model should be able to employ the term "Joplin" in various forms. E.g. by reading
"Joplin's GUI differs significantly between its React Native Android app and its Windows app" and
inserting punctuation appropriately.

Unfortunately, this file is likely to have little or no effect: It's very short compared to the other
documents in the training corpus, it only mentions the relevant terms a few times, and may occasionally
be included in the validation set, rather than the training set.

Here's the main text of the document:

Joplin is a note-taking and to-do application that supports Windows, Linux, iOS, Android, web, and other platforms.
Its iOS, Android, and web platforms were written using React Native. Its Windows, Linux, and MacOS apps
use Electron.

Electron is an interesting word. Usually, it's lowercase (e.g. "electron"). However, in some cases, it
should be uppercase (e.g. "Electron"). I'm curious - will the model be intelligent enough to recognize,
from context, which "electron" is being referred to?

I'm also curious how well the model will handle question punctuation. Will it be different in English and
French? The same? It's hard to say.

Here are a few sample questions:

Why is this program not working? Why are my sentences not properly punctuated? Why doesn't it properly punctuate the word "I'm"?

I am testing this application. Does it work?

What about names? Are names capitalized correctly? These are names: Bob, Canada, Greenland, Eve, Edward, Alice,
and Jabberwocky. Does it convert them correctly?

How about conjunctions? This is in the training data, so I'm including the conjunctions in sentences. This paragraph has a few: Haven't
you punctuated this sentence? She'll punctuate this sentence. They'll do something. I'm editing this file with a text editor. It's
adding the letters I type to the screen.

Though not present in much of the training data, common abbreviations should also be handled. Here are some: CPU, TPU, USA, EU, IRS, SEC, JS, TS, and RNN. The last one, RNN, stands for "Recurrent Neural Network".

On the topic of training data, many of the documents incorporated thus far are very old. As a result, they have long sentences with many commas.
I'm curious whether any modern texts could be incorporated. Doing so could improve the model's accuracy.

While preparing the training data, I've observed that the word "hello" is rather uncommon. It isn't
even included in the list of the 10,000 most common words! I expect "hello" to be more common in spoken text, which is one of the
things this project will be applied to. In addition to "hello", there's also "program", "computer", "phone", and "internet". Here's a
sentence that uses some of them: "My computer and phone can both access the internet".

Above, I've repeated "hello" a few times, so it is likely to now be included in the vocabulary. However, there may be

you punctuated this sentence? She'll punctuate this sentence. They'll do something. I'm editing this file with a text editor. It's
adding the letters I type to the screen.

Though not present in much of the training data, common abbreviations should also be handled. Here are some: CPU, TPU, USA, EU, IRS, SEC, JS, TS, and RNN. The last one, RNN, stands for "Recurrent Neural Network".

On the topic of training data, many of the documents incorporated thus far are very old. As a result, they have long sentences with many commas.
I'm curious whether any modern texts could be incorporated. Doing so could improve the model's accuracy.

While preparing the training data, I've observed that the word "hello" is rather uncommon. It isn't
even included in the list of the 10,000 most common words! I expect "hello" to be more common in spoken text, which is one of the
things this project will be applied to. In addition to "hello", there's also "program", "computer", "phone", and "internet". Here's a
sentence that uses some of them: "My computer and phone can both access the internet".

Above, I've repeated "hello" a few times, so it is likely to now be included in the vocabulary. However, there may be
similar words that don't appear frequently in the training data. As such, while designing the model, we should be sure that
unknown words (like "hello") are preserved.

It would also be nice if "Joplin" was common enough to be included in the model's vocabulary. This would help ensure that the
model knows to properly capitalize it. I'm listing "Joplin" several times here as part of an effort to make this happen:
Joplin Desktop, Joplin Mobile, Joplin CLI, Joplin Web, Joplin's documentation, Joplin notebook, Joplin note, Joplin's editor, Joplin,
and Joplin.

Before deploying the model, it will be important to check for bias caused by its training data. For example, are certain pronouns and
honorifics over represented in the training data? Will the model understand "Mr. Name" but not "Ms. Name"?

I'm repeating the above text to emphasize it in the training data. This should offset some of the other sources, but runs the risk of
biasing the model towards my own writing.

This document's goal is to provide a small amount of additional data for fine-tuning the model.

Rationale: The majority of the model's data is from the 1800s and early 1900s. As such, the
lexicon and grammar employed by the model are somewhat archaic (to-do: find an archaic synonym
for "somewhat").

For example, the model should be able to employ the term "Joplin" in various forms. E.g. by reading
"Joplin's GUI differs significantly between its React Native Android app and its Windows app" and
inserting punctuation appropriately.

Unfortunately, this file is likely to have little or no effect: It's very short compared to the other
documents in the training corpus, it only mentions the relevant terms a few times, and may occasionally
be included in the validation set, rather than the training set.

Here's the main text of the document:

Joplin is a note-taking and to-do application that supports Windows, Linux, iOS, Android, web, and other platforms.
Its iOS, Android, and web platforms were written using React Native. Its Windows, Linux, and MacOS apps
use Electron.

Electron is an interesting word. Usually, it's lowercase (e.g. "electron"). However, in some cases, it
should be uppercase (e.g. "Electron"). I'm curious - will the model be intelligent enough to recognize,
from context, which "electron" is being referred to?

I'm also curious how well the model will handle question punctuation. Will it be different in English and
French? The same? It's hard to say.

Here are a few sample questions:

Why is this program not working? Why are my sentences not properly punctuated? Why doesn't it properly punctuate the word "I'm"?

I am testing this application. Does it work?

What about names? Are names capitalized correctly? These are names: Bob, Canada, Greenland, Eve, Edward, Alice,
and Jabberwocky. Does it convert them correctly?

be included in the validation set, rather than the training set.

Here's the main text of the document:

Joplin is a note-taking and to-do application that supports Windows, Linux, iOS, Android, web, and other platforms.
Its iOS, Android, and web platforms were written using React Native. Its Windows, Linux, and MacOS apps
use Electron.

Electron is an interesting word. Usually, it's lowercase (e.g. "electron"). However, in some cases, it
should be uppercase (e.g. "Electron"). I'm curious - will the model be intelligent enough to recognize,
from context, which "electron" is being referred to?

I'm also curious how well the model will handle question punctuation. Will it be different in English and
French? The same? It's hard to say.

Here are a few sample questions:

Why is this program not working? Why are my sentences not properly punctuated? Why doesn't it properly punctuate the word "I'm"?

I am testing this application. Does it work?

What about names? Are names capitalized correctly? These are names: Bob, Canada, Greenland, Eve, Edward, Alice,
and Jabberwocky. Does it convert them correctly?

How about conjunctions? This is in the training data, so I'm including the conjunctions in sentences. This paragraph has a few: Haven't
you punctuated this sentence? She'll punctuate this sentence. They'll do something. I'm editing this file with a text editor. It's
adding the letters I type to the screen.

Though not present in much of the training data, common abbreviations should also be handled. Here are some: CPU, TPU, USA, EU, IRS, SEC, JS, TS, and RNN. The last one, RNN, stands for "Recurrent Neural Network".

On the topic of training data, many of the documents incorporated thus far are very old. As a result, they have long sentences with many commas.
I'm curious whether any modern texts could be incorporated. Doing so could improve the model's accuracy.

While preparing the training data, I've observed that the word "hello" is rather uncommon. It isn't
even included in the list of the 10,000 most common words! I expect "hello" to be more common in spoken text, which is one of the
things this project will be applied to. In addition to "hello", there's also "program", "computer", "phone", and "internet". Here's a
sentence that uses some of them: "My computer and phone can both access the internet".

Above, I've repeated "hello" a few times, so it is likely to now be included in the vocabulary. However, there may be
similar words that don't appear frequently in the training data. As such, while designing the model, we should be sure that
unknown words (like "hello") are preserved.

It would also be nice if "Joplin" was common enough to be included in the model's vocabulary. This would help ensure that the
model knows to properly capitalize it. I'm listing "Joplin" several times here as part of an effort to make this happen:
Joplin Desktop, Joplin Mobile, Joplin CLI, Joplin Web, Joplin's documentation, Joplin notebook, Joplin note, Joplin's editor, Joplin,
and Joplin.

Before deploying the model, it will be important to check for bias caused by its training data. For example, are certain pronouns and
honorifics over represented in the training data? Will the model understand "Mr. Name" but not "Ms. Name"?

I'm repeating the above text to emphasize it in the training data. This should offset some of the other sources, but runs the risk of
biasing the model towards my own writing.

This document's goal is to provide a small amount of additional data for fine-tuning the model.

Rationale: The majority of the model's data is from the 1800s and early 1900s. As such, the
lexicon and grammar employed by the model are somewhat archaic (to-do: find an archaic synonym
for "somewhat").

For example, the model should be able to employ the term "Joplin" in various forms. E.g. by reading
"Joplin's GUI differs significantly between its React Native Android app and its Windows app" and
inserting punctuation appropriately.

Joplin Desktop, Joplin Mobile, Joplin CLI, Joplin Web, Joplin's documentation, Joplin notebook, Joplin note, Joplin's editor, Joplin,
and Joplin.

Before deploying the model, it will be important to check for bias caused by its training data. For example, are certain pronouns and
honorifics over represented in the training data? Will the model understand "Mr. Name" but not "Ms. Name"?

I'm repeating the above text to emphasize it in the training data. This should offset some of the other sources, but runs the risk of
biasing the model towards my own writing.

This document's goal is to provide a small amount of additional data for fine-tuning the model.

Rationale: The majority of the model's data is from the 1800s and early 1900s. As such, the
lexicon and grammar employed by the model are somewhat archaic (to-do: find an archaic synonym
for "somewhat").

For example, the model should be able to employ the term "Joplin" in various forms. E.g. by reading
"Joplin's GUI differs significantly between its React Native Android app and its Windows app" and
inserting punctuation appropriately.

Unfortunately, this file is likely to have little or no effect: It's very short compared to the other
documents in the training corpus, it only mentions the relevant terms a few times, and may occasionally
be included in the validation set, rather than the training set.

Here's the main text of the document:

Joplin is a note-taking and to-do application that supports Windows, Linux, iOS, Android, web, and other platforms.
Its iOS, Android, and web platforms were written using React Native. Its Windows, Linux, and MacOS apps
use Electron.

Electron is an interesting word. Usually, it's lowercase (e.g. "electron"). However, in some cases, it
should be uppercase (e.g. "Electron"). I'm curious - will the model be intelligent enough to recognize,
from context, which "electron" is being referred to?

I'm also curious how well the model will handle question punctuation. Will it be different in English and
French? The same? It's hard to say.

Here are a few sample questions:

Why is this program not working? Why are my sentences not properly punctuated? Why doesn't it properly punctuate the word "I'm"?

I am testing this application. Does it work?

What about names? Are names capitalized correctly? These are names: Bob, Canada, Greenland, Eve, Edward, Alice,
and Jabberwocky. Does it convert them correctly?

How about conjunctions? This is in the training data, so I'm including the conjunctions in sentences. This paragraph has a few: Haven't
you punctuated this sentence? She'll punctuate this sentence. They'll do something. I'm editing this file with a text editor. It's
adding the letters I type to the screen.

Though not present in much of the training data, common abbreviations should also be handled. Here are some: CPU, TPU, USA, EU, IRS, SEC, JS, TS, and RNN. The last one, RNN, stands for "Recurrent Neural Network".

On the topic of training data, many of the documents incorporated thus far are very old. As a result, they have long sentences with many commas.
I'm curious whether any modern texts could be incorporated. Doing so could improve the model's accuracy.

While preparing the training data, I've observed that the word "hello" is rather uncommon. It isn't
even included in the list of the 10,000 most common words! I expect "hello" to be more common in spoken text, which is one of the
things this project will be applied to. In addition to "hello", there's also "program", "computer", "phone", and "internet". Here's a
sentence that uses some of them: "My computer and phone can both access the internet".

Above, I've repeated "hello" a few times, so it is likely to now be included in the vocabulary. However, there may be
similar words that don't appear frequently in the training data. As such, while designing the model, we should be sure that
unknown words (like "hello") are preserved.

Though not present in much of the training data, common abbreviations should also be handled. Here are some: CPU, TPU, USA, EU, IRS, SEC, JS, TS, and RNN. The last one, RNN, stands for "Recurrent Neural Network".

On the topic of training data, many of the documents incorporated thus far are very old. As a result, they have long sentences with many commas.
I'm curious whether any modern texts could be incorporated. Doing so could improve the model's accuracy.

While preparing the training data, I've observed that the word "hello" is rather uncommon. It isn't
even included in the list of the 10,000 most common words! I expect "hello" to be more common in spoken text, which is one of the
things this project will be applied to. In addition to "hello", there's also "program", "computer", "phone", and "internet". Here's a
sentence that uses some of them: "My computer and phone can both access the internet".

Above, I've repeated "hello" a few times, so it is likely to now be included in the vocabulary. However, there may be
similar words that don't appear frequently in the training data. As such, while designing the model, we should be sure that
unknown words (like "hello") are preserved.

It would also be nice if "Joplin" was common enough to be included in the model's vocabulary. This would help ensure that the
model knows to properly capitalize it. I'm listing "Joplin" several times here as part of an effort to make this happen:
Joplin Desktop, Joplin Mobile, Joplin CLI, Joplin Web, Joplin's documentation, Joplin notebook, Joplin note, Joplin's editor, Joplin,
and Joplin.

Before deploying the model, it will be important to check for bias caused by its training data. For example, are certain pronouns and
honorifics over represented in the training data? Will the model understand "Mr. Name" but not "Ms. Name"?

I'm repeating the above text to emphasize it in the training data. This should offset some of the other sources, but runs the risk of
biasing the model towards my own writing.

This document's goal is to provide a small amount of additional data for fine-tuning the model.

Rationale: The majority of the model's data is from the 1800s and early 1900s. As such, the
lexicon and grammar employed by the model are somewhat archaic (to-do: find an archaic synonym
for "somewhat").

For example, the model should be able to employ the term "Joplin" in various forms. E.g. by reading
"Joplin's GUI differs significantly between its React Native Android app and its Windows app" and
inserting punctuation appropriately.

Unfortunately, this file is likely to have little or no effect: It's very short compared to the other
documents in the training corpus, it only mentions the relevant terms a few times, and may occasionally
be included in the validation set, rather than the training set.

Here's the main text of the document:

Joplin is a note-taking and to-do application that supports Windows, Linux, iOS, Android, web, and other platforms.
Its iOS, Android, and web platforms were written using React Native. Its Windows, Linux, and MacOS apps
use Electron.

Electron is an interesting word. Usually, it's lowercase (e.g. "electron"). However, in some cases, it
should be uppercase (e.g. "Electron"). I'm curious - will the model be intelligent enough to recognize,
from context, which "electron" is being referred to?

I'm also curious how well the model will handle question punctuation. Will it be different in English and
French? The same? It's hard to say.

Here are a few sample questions:

Why is this program not working? Why are my sentences not properly punctuated? Why doesn't it properly punctuate the word "I'm"?

I am testing this application. Does it work?

What about names? Are names capitalized correctly? These are names: Bob, Canada, Greenland, Eve, Edward, Alice,
and Jabberwocky. Does it convert them correctly?

How about conjunctions? This is in the training data, so I'm including the conjunctions in sentences. This paragraph has a few: Haven't

Its iOS, Android, and web platforms were written using React Native. Its Windows, Linux, and MacOS apps
use Electron.

Electron is an interesting word. Usually, it's lowercase (e.g. "electron"). However, in some cases, it
should be uppercase (e.g. "Electron"). I'm curious - will the model be intelligent enough to recognize,
from context, which "electron" is being referred to?

I'm also curious how well the model will handle question punctuation. Will it be different in English and
French? The same? It's hard to say.

Here are a few sample questions:

Why is this program not working? Why are my sentences not properly punctuated? Why doesn't it properly punctuate the word "I'm"?

I am testing this application. Does it work?

What about names? Are names capitalized correctly? These are names: Bob, Canada, Greenland, Eve, Edward, Alice,
and Jabberwocky. Does it convert them correctly?

How about conjunctions? This is in the training data, so I'm including the conjunctions in sentences. This paragraph has a few: Haven't
you punctuated this sentence? She'll punctuate this sentence. They'll do something. I'm editing this file with a text editor. It's
adding the letters I type to the screen.

Though not present in much of the training data, common abbreviations should also be handled. Here are some: CPU, TPU, USA, EU, IRS, SEC, JS, TS, and RNN. The last one, RNN, stands for "Recurrent Neural Network".

On the topic of training data, many of the documents incorporated thus far are very old. As a result, they have long sentences with many commas.
I'm curious whether any modern texts could be incorporated. Doing so could improve the model's accuracy.

While preparing the training data, I've observed that the word "hello" is rather uncommon. It isn't
even included in the list of the 10,000 most common words! I expect "hello" to be more common in spoken text, which is one of the
things this project will be applied to. In addition to "hello", there's also "program", "computer", "phone", and "internet". Here's a
sentence that uses some of them: "My computer and phone can both access the internet".

Above, I've repeated "hello" a few times, so it is likely to now be included in the vocabulary. However, there may be
similar words that don't appear frequently in the training data. As such, while designing the model, we should be sure that
unknown words (like "hello") are preserved.

It would also be nice if "Joplin" was common enough to be included in the model's vocabulary. This would help ensure that the
model knows to properly capitalize it. I'm listing "Joplin" several times here as part of an effort to make this happen:
Joplin Desktop, Joplin Mobile, Joplin CLI, Joplin Web, Joplin's documentation, Joplin notebook, Joplin note, Joplin's editor, Joplin,
and Joplin.

Before deploying the model, it will be important to check for bias caused by its training data. For example, are certain pronouns and
honorifics over represented in the training data? Will the model understand "Mr. Name" but not "Ms. Name"?

I'm repeating the above text to emphasize it in the training data. This should offset some of the other sources, but runs the risk of
biasing the model towards my own writing.

This document's goal is to provide a small amount of additional data for fine-tuning the model.

Rationale: The majority of the model's data is from the 1800s and early 1900s. As such, the
lexicon and grammar employed by the model are somewhat archaic (to-do: find an archaic synonym
for "somewhat").

For example, the model should be able to employ the term "Joplin" in various forms. E.g. by reading
"Joplin's GUI differs significantly between its React Native Android app and its Windows app" and
inserting punctuation appropriately.

Unfortunately, this file is likely to have little or no effect: It's very short compared to the other
documents in the training corpus, it only mentions the relevant terms a few times, and may occasionally
be included in the validation set, rather than the training set.

honorifics over represented in the training data? Will the model understand "Mr. Name" but not "Ms. Name"?

I'm repeating the above text to emphasize it in the training data. This should offset some of the other sources, but runs the risk of
biasing the model towards my own writing.

This document's goal is to provide a small amount of additional data for fine-tuning the model.

Rationale: The majority of the model's data is from the 1800s and early 1900s. As such, the
lexicon and grammar employed by the model are somewhat archaic (to-do: find an archaic synonym
for "somewhat").

For example, the model should be able to employ the term "Joplin" in various forms. E.g. by reading
"Joplin's GUI differs significantly between its React Native Android app and its Windows app" and
inserting punctuation appropriately.

Unfortunately, this file is likely to have little or no effect: It's very short compared to the other
documents in the training corpus, it only mentions the relevant terms a few times, and may occasionally
be included in the validation set, rather than the training set.

Here's the main text of the document:

Joplin is a note-taking and to-do application that supports Windows, Linux, iOS, Android, web, and other platforms.
Its iOS, Android, and web platforms were written using React Native. Its Windows, Linux, and MacOS apps
use Electron.

Electron is an interesting word. Usually, it's lowercase (e.g. "electron"). However, in some cases, it
should be uppercase (e.g. "Electron"). I'm curious - will the model be intelligent enough to recognize,
from context, which "electron" is being referred to?

I'm also curious how well the model will handle question punctuation. Will it be different in English and
French? The same? It's hard to say.

Here are a few sample questions:

Why is this program not working? Why are my sentences not properly punctuated? Why doesn't it properly punctuate the word "I'm"?

I am testing this application. Does it work?

What about names? Are names capitalized correctly? These are names: Bob, Canada, Greenland, Eve, Edward, Alice,
and Jabberwocky. Does it convert them correctly?

How about conjunctions? This is in the training data, so I'm including the conjunctions in sentences. This paragraph has a few: Haven't
you punctuated this sentence? She'll punctuate this sentence. They'll do something. I'm editing this file with a text editor. It's
adding the letters I type to the screen.

Though not present in much of the training data, common abbreviations should also be handled. Here are some: CPU, TPU, USA, EU, IRS, SEC, JS, TS, and RNN. The last one, RNN, stands for "Recurrent Neural Network".

On the topic of training data, many of the documents incorporated thus far are very old. As a result, they have long sentences with many commas.
I'm curious whether any modern texts could be incorporated. Doing so could improve the model's accuracy.

While preparing the training data, I've observed that the word "hello" is rather uncommon. It isn't
even included in the list of the 10,000 most common words! I expect "hello" to be more common in spoken text, which is one of the
things this project will be applied to. In addition to "hello", there's also "program", "computer", "phone", and "internet". Here's a
sentence that uses some of them: "My computer and phone can both access the internet".

Above, I've repeated "hello" a few times, so it is likely to now be included in the vocabulary. However, there may be
similar words that don't appear frequently in the training data. As such, while designing the model, we should be sure that
unknown words (like "hello") are preserved.

It would also be nice if "Joplin" was common enough to be included in the model's vocabulary. This would help ensure that the
model knows to properly capitalize it. I'm listing "Joplin" several times here as part of an effort to make this happen:
Joplin Desktop, Joplin Mobile, Joplin CLI, Joplin Web, Joplin's documentation, Joplin notebook, Joplin note, Joplin's editor, Joplin,

even included in the list of the 10,000 most common words! I expect "hello" to be more common in spoken text, which is one of the
things this project will be applied to. In addition to "hello", there's also "program", "computer", "phone", and "internet". Here's a
sentence that uses some of them: "My computer and phone can both access the internet".

Above, I've repeated "hello" a few times, so it is likely to now be included in the vocabulary. However, there may be
similar words that don't appear frequently in the training data. As such, while designing the model, we should be sure that
unknown words (like "hello") are preserved.

It would also be nice if "Joplin" was common enough to be included in the model's vocabulary. This would help ensure that the
model knows to properly capitalize it. I'm listing "Joplin" several times here as part of an effort to make this happen:
Joplin Desktop, Joplin Mobile, Joplin CLI, Joplin Web, Joplin's documentation, Joplin notebook, Joplin note, Joplin's editor, Joplin,
and Joplin.

Before deploying the model, it will be important to check for bias caused by its training data. For example, are certain pronouns and
honorifics over represented in the training data? Will the model understand "Mr. Name" but not "Ms. Name"?

I'm repeating the above text to emphasize it in the training data. This should offset some of the other sources, but runs the risk of
biasing the model towards my own writing.

This document's goal is to provide a small amount of additional data for fine-tuning the model.

Rationale: The majority of the model's data is from the 1800s and early 1900s. As such, the
lexicon and grammar employed by the model are somewhat archaic (to-do: find an archaic synonym
for "somewhat").

For example, the model should be able to employ the term "Joplin" in various forms. E.g. by reading
"Joplin's GUI differs significantly between its React Native Android app and its Windows app" and
inserting punctuation appropriately.

Unfortunately, this file is likely to have little or no effect: It's very short compared to the other
documents in the training corpus, it only mentions the relevant terms a few times, and may occasionally
be included in the validation set, rather than the training set.

Here's the main text of the document:

Joplin is a note-taking and to-do application that supports Windows, Linux, iOS, Android, web, and other platforms.
Its iOS, Android, and web platforms were written using React Native. Its Windows, Linux, and MacOS apps
use Electron.

Electron is an interesting word. Usually, it's lowercase (e.g. "electron"). However, in some cases, it
should be uppercase (e.g. "Electron"). I'm curious - will the model be intelligent enough to recognize,
from context, which "electron" is being referred to?

I'm also curious how well the model will handle question punctuation. Will it be different in English and
French? The same? It's hard to say.

Here are a few sample questions:

Why is this program not working? Why are my sentences not properly punctuated? Why doesn't it properly punctuate the word "I'm"?

I am testing this application. Does it work?

What about names? Are names capitalized correctly? These are names: Bob, Canada, Greenland, Eve, Edward, Alice,
and Jabberwocky. Does it convert them correctly?

How about conjunctions? This is in the training data, so I'm including the conjunctions in sentences. This paragraph has a few: Haven't
you punctuated this sentence? She'll punctuate this sentence. They'll do something. I'm editing this file with a text editor. It's
adding the letters I type to the screen.

Though not present in much of the training data, common abbreviations should also be handled. Here are some: CPU, TPU, USA, EU, IRS, SEC, JS, TS, and RNN. The last one, RNN, stands for "Recurrent Neural Network".

On the topic of training data, many of the documents incorporated thus far are very old. As a result, they have long sentences with many commas.

Here are a few sample questions:

Why is this program not working? Why are my sentences not properly punctuated? Why doesn't it properly punctuate the word "I'm"?

I am testing this application. Does it work?

What about names? Are names capitalized correctly? These are names: Bob, Canada, Greenland, Eve, Edward, Alice,
and Jabberwocky. Does it convert them correctly?

How about conjunctions? This is in the training data, so I'm including the conjunctions in sentences. This paragraph has a few: Haven't
you punctuated this sentence? She'll punctuate this sentence. They'll do something. I'm editing this file with a text editor. It's
adding the letters I type to the screen.

Though not present in much of the training data, common abbreviations should also be handled. Here are some: CPU, TPU, USA, EU, IRS, SEC, JS, TS, and RNN. The last one, RNN, stands for "Recurrent Neural Network".

On the topic of training data, many of the documents incorporated thus far are very old. As a result, they have long sentences with many commas.
I'm curious whether any modern texts could be incorporated. Doing so could improve the model's accuracy.

While preparing the training data, I've observed that the word "hello" is rather uncommon. It isn't
even included in the list of the 10,000 most common words! I expect "hello" to be more common in spoken text, which is one of the
things this project will be applied to. In addition to "hello", there's also "program", "computer", "phone", and "internet". Here's a
sentence that uses some of them: "My computer and phone can both access the internet".

Above, I've repeated "hello" a few times, so it is likely to now be included in the vocabulary. However, there may be
similar words that don't appear frequently in the training data. As such, while designing the model, we should be sure that
unknown words (like "hello") are preserved.

It would also be nice if "Joplin" was common enough to be included in the model's vocabulary. This would help ensure that the
model knows to properly capitalize it. I'm listing "Joplin" several times here as part of an effort to make this happen:
Joplin Desktop, Joplin Mobile, Joplin CLI, Joplin Web, Joplin's documentation, Joplin notebook, Joplin note, Joplin's editor, Joplin,
and Joplin.

Before deploying the model, it will be important to check for bias caused by its training data. For example, are certain pronouns and
honorifics over represented in the training data? Will the model understand "Mr. Name" but not "Ms. Name"?

I'm repeating the above text to emphasize it in the training data. This should offset some of the other sources, but runs the risk of
biasing the model towards my own writing.

This document's goal is to provide a small amount of additional data for fine-tuning the model.

Rationale: The majority of the model's data is from the 1800s and early 1900s. As such, the
lexicon and grammar employed by the model are somewhat archaic (to-do: find an archaic synonym
for "somewhat").

For example, the model should be able to employ the term "Joplin" in various forms. E.g. by reading
"Joplin's GUI differs significantly between its React Native Android app and its Windows app" and
inserting punctuation appropriately.

Unfortunately, this file is likely to have little or no effect: It's very short compared to the other
documents in the training corpus, it only mentions the relevant terms a few times, and may occasionally
be included in the validation set, rather than the training set.

Here's the main text of the document:

Joplin is a note-taking and to-do application that supports Windows, Linux, iOS, Android, web, and other platforms.

use Electron.

Electron is an interesting word. Usually, it's lowercase (e.g. "electron"). However, in some cases, it
should be uppercase (e.g. "Electron"). I'm curious - will the model be intelligent enough to recognize,
from context, which "electron" is being referred to?

For example, the model should be able to employ the term "Joplin" in various forms. E.g. by reading
"Joplin's GUI differs significantly between its React Native Android app and its Windows app" and
inserting punctuation appropriately.

Unfortunately, this file is likely to have little or no effect: It's very short compared to the other
documents in the training corpus, it only mentions the relevant terms a few times, and may occasionally
be included in the validation set, rather than the training set.

Here's the main text of the document:

Joplin is a note-taking and to-do application that supports Windows, Linux, iOS, Android, web, and other platforms.
Its iOS, Android, and web platforms were written using React Native. Its Windows, Linux, and MacOS apps
use Electron.

Electron is an interesting word. Usually, it's lowercase (e.g. "electron"). However, in some cases, it
should be uppercase (e.g. "Electron"). I'm curious - will the model be intelligent enough to recognize,
from context, which "electron" is being referred to?

I'm also curious how well the model will handle question punctuation. Will it be different in English and
French? The same? It's hard to say.

Here are a few sample questions:

Why is this program not working? Why are my sentences not properly punctuated? Why doesn't it properly punctuate the word "I'm"?

I am testing this application. Does it work?

What about names? Are names capitalized correctly? These are names: Bob, Canada, Greenland, Eve, Edward, Alice,
and Jabberwocky. Does it convert them correctly?

How about conjunctions? This is in the training data, so I'm including the conjunctions in sentences. This paragraph has a few: Haven't
you punctuated this sentence? She'll punctuate this sentence. They'll do something. I'm editing this file with a text editor. It's
adding the letters I type to the screen.

Though not present in much of the training data, common abbreviations should also be handled. Here are some: CPU, TPU, USA, EU, IRS, SEC, JS, TS, and RNN. The last one, RNN, stands for "Recurrent Neural Network".

On the topic of training data, many of the documents incorporated thus far are very old. As a result, they have long sentences with many commas.
I'm curious whether any modern texts could be incorporated. Doing so could improve the model's accuracy.

While preparing the training data, I've observed that the word "hello" is rather uncommon. It isn't
even included in the list of the 10,000 most common words! I expect "hello" to be more common in spoken text, which is one of the
things this project will be applied to. In addition to "hello", there's also "program", "computer", "phone", and "internet". Here's a
sentence that uses some of them: "My computer and phone can both access the internet".

Above, I've repeated "hello" a few times, so it is likely to now be included in the vocabulary. However, there may be
similar words that don't appear frequently in the training data. As such, while designing the model, we should be sure that
unknown words (like "hello") are preserved.

It would also be nice if "Joplin" was common enough to be included in the model's vocabulary. This would help ensure that the
model knows to properly capitalize it. I'm listing "Joplin" several times here as part of an effort to make this happen:
Joplin Desktop, Joplin Mobile, Joplin CLI, Joplin Web, Joplin's documentation, Joplin notebook, Joplin note, Joplin's editor, Joplin,
and Joplin.

Before deploying the model, it will be important to check for bias caused by its training data. For example, are certain pronouns and
honorifics over represented in the training data? Will the model understand "Mr. Name" but not "Ms. Name"?

I'm repeating the above text to emphasize it in the training data. This should offset some of the other sources, but runs the risk of
biasing the model towards my own writing.

This document's goal is to provide a small amount of additional data for fine-tuning the model.

Rationale: The majority of the model's data is from the 1800s and early 1900s. As such, the
lexicon and grammar employed by the model are somewhat archaic (to-do: find an archaic synonym
for "somewhat").

unknown words (like "hello") are preserved.

It would also be nice if "Joplin" was common enough to be included in the model's vocabulary. This would help ensure that the
model knows to properly capitalize it. I'm listing "Joplin" several times here as part of an effort to make this happen:
Joplin Desktop, Joplin Mobile, Joplin CLI, Joplin Web, Joplin's documentation, Joplin notebook, Joplin note, Joplin's editor, Joplin,
and Joplin.

Before deploying the model, it will be important to check for bias caused by its training data. For example, are certain pronouns and
honorifics over represented in the training data? Will the model understand "Mr. Name" but not "Ms. Name"?

I'm repeating the above text to emphasize it in the training data. This should offset some of the other sources, but runs the risk of
biasing the model towards my own writing.

This document's goal is to provide a small amount of additional data for fine-tuning the model.

Rationale: The majority of the model's data is from the 1800s and early 1900s. As such, the
lexicon and grammar employed by the model are somewhat archaic (to-do: find an archaic synonym
for "somewhat").

For example, the model should be able to employ the term "Joplin" in various forms. E.g. by reading
"Joplin's GUI differs significantly between its React Native Android app and its Windows app" and
inserting punctuation appropriately.

Unfortunately, this file is likely to have little or no effect: It's very short compared to the other
documents in the training corpus, it only mentions the relevant terms a few times, and may occasionally
be included in the validation set, rather than the training set.

Here's the main text of the document:

Joplin is a note-taking and to-do application that supports Windows, Linux, iOS, Android, web, and other platforms.
Its iOS, Android, and web platforms were written using React Native. Its Windows, Linux, and MacOS apps
use Electron.

Electron is an interesting word. Usually, it's lowercase (e.g. "electron"). However, in some cases, it
should be uppercase (e.g. "Electron"). I'm curious - will the model be intelligent enough to recognize,
from context, which "electron" is being referred to?

I'm also curious how well the model will handle question punctuation. Will it be different in English and
French? The same? It's hard to say.

Here are a few sample questions:

Why is this program not working? Why are my sentences not properly punctuated? Why doesn't it properly punctuate the word "I'm"?

I am testing this application. Does it work?

What about names? Are names capitalized correctly? These are names: Bob, Canada, Greenland, Eve, Edward, Alice,
and Jabberwocky. Does it convert them correctly?

How about conjunctions? This is in the training data, so I'm including the conjunctions in sentences. This paragraph has a few: Haven't
you punctuated this sentence? She'll punctuate this sentence. They'll do something. I'm editing this file with a text editor. It's
adding the letters I type to the screen.

Though not present in much of the training data, common abbreviations should also be handled. Here are some: CPU, TPU, USA, EU, IRS, SEC, JS, TS, and RNN. The last one, RNN, stands for "Recurrent Neural Network".

On the topic of training data, many of the documents incorporated thus far are very old. As a result, they have long sentences with many commas.
I'm curious whether any modern texts could be incorporated. Doing so could improve the model's accuracy.

While preparing the training data, I've observed that the word "hello" is rather uncommon. It isn't
even included in the list of the 10,000 most common words! I expect "hello" to be more common in spoken text, which is one of the
things this project will be applied to. In addition to "hello", there's also "program", "computer", "phone", and "internet". Here's a
sentence that uses some of them: "My computer and phone can both access the internet".

Above, I've repeated "hello" a few times, so it is likely to now be included in the vocabulary. However, there may be

you punctuated this sentence? She'll punctuate this sentence. They'll do something. I'm editing this file with a text editor. It's
adding the letters I type to the screen.

Though not present in much of the training data, common abbreviations should also be handled. Here are some: CPU, TPU, USA, EU, IRS, SEC, JS, TS, and RNN. The last one, RNN, stands for "Recurrent Neural Network".

On the topic of training data, many of the documents incorporated thus far are very old. As a result, they have long sentences with many commas.
I'm curious whether any modern texts could be incorporated. Doing so could improve the model's accuracy.

While preparing the training data, I've observed that the word "hello" is rather uncommon. It isn't
even included in the list of the 10,000 most common words! I expect "hello" to be more common in spoken text, which is one of the
things this project will be applied to. In addition to "hello", there's also "program", "computer", "phone", and "internet". Here's a
sentence that uses some of them: "My computer and phone can both access the internet".

Above, I've repeated "hello" a few times, so it is likely to now be included in the vocabulary. However, there may be
similar words that don't appear frequently in the training data. As such, while designing the model, we should be sure that
unknown words (like "hello") are preserved.

It would also be nice if "Joplin" was common enough to be included in the model's vocabulary. This would help ensure that the
model knows to properly capitalize it. I'm listing "Joplin" several times here as part of an effort to make this happen:
Joplin Desktop, Joplin Mobile, Joplin CLI, Joplin Web, Joplin's documentation, Joplin notebook, Joplin note, Joplin's editor, Joplin,
and Joplin.

Before deploying the model, it will be important to check for bias caused by its training data. For example, are certain pronouns and
honorifics over represented in the training data? Will the model understand "Mr. Name" but not "Ms. Name"?

I'm repeating the above text to emphasize it in the training data. This should offset some of the other sources, but runs the risk of
biasing the model towards my own writing.

This document's goal is to provide a small amount of additional data for fine-tuning the model.

Rationale: The majority of the model's data is from the 1800s and early 1900s. As such, the
lexicon and grammar employed by the model are somewhat archaic (to-do: find an archaic synonym
for "somewhat").

For example, the model should be able to employ the term "Joplin" in various forms. E.g. by reading
"Joplin's GUI differs significantly between its React Native Android app and its Windows app" and
inserting punctuation appropriately.

Unfortunately, this file is likely to have little or no effect: It's very short compared to the other
documents in the training corpus, it only mentions the relevant terms a few times, and may occasionally
be included in the validation set, rather than the training set.

Here's the main text of the document:

Joplin is a note-taking and to-do application that supports Windows, Linux, iOS, Android, web, and other platforms.
Its iOS, Android, and web platforms were written using React Native. Its Windows, Linux, and MacOS apps
use Electron.

Electron is an interesting word. Usually, it's lowercase (e.g. "electron"). However, in some cases, it
should be uppercase (e.g. "Electron"). I'm curious - will the model be intelligent enough to recognize,
from context, which "electron" is being referred to?

I'm also curious how well the model will handle question punctuation. Will it be different in English and
French? The same? It's hard to say.

Here are a few sample questions:

Why is this program not working? Why are my sentences not properly punctuated? Why doesn't it properly punctuate the word "I'm"?

I am testing this application. Does it work?

What about names? Are names capitalized correctly? These are names: Bob, Canada, Greenland, Eve, Edward, Alice,
and Jabberwocky. Does it convert them correctly?

be included in the validation set, rather than the training set.

Here's the main text of the document:

Joplin is a note-taking and to-do application that supports Windows, Linux, iOS, Android, web, and other platforms.
Its iOS, Android, and web platforms were written using React Native. Its Windows, Linux, and MacOS apps
use Electron.

Electron is an interesting word. Usually, it's lowercase (e.g. "electron"). However, in some cases, it
should be uppercase (e.g. "Electron"). I'm curious - will the model be intelligent enough to recognize,
from context, which "electron" is being referred to?

I'm also curious how well the model will handle question punctuation. Will it be different in English and
French? The same? It's hard to say.

Here are a few sample questions:

Why is this program not working? Why are my sentences not properly punctuated? Why doesn't it properly punctuate the word "I'm"?

I am testing this application. Does it work?

What about names? Are names capitalized correctly? These are names: Bob, Canada, Greenland, Eve, Edward, Alice,
and Jabberwocky. Does it convert them correctly?

How about conjunctions? This is in the training data, so I'm including the conjunctions in sentences. This paragraph has a few: Haven't
you punctuated this sentence? She'll punctuate this sentence. They'll do something. I'm editing this file with a text editor. It's
adding the letters I type to the screen.

Though not present in much of the training data, common abbreviations should also be handled. Here are some: CPU, TPU, USA, EU, IRS, SEC, JS, TS, and RNN. The last one, RNN, stands for "Recurrent Neural Network".

On the topic of training data, many of the documents incorporated thus far are very old. As a result, they have long sentences with many commas.
I'm curious whether any modern texts could be incorporated. Doing so could improve the model's accuracy.

While preparing the training data, I've observed that the word "hello" is rather uncommon. It isn't
even included in the list of the 10,000 most common words! I expect "hello" to be more common in spoken text, which is one of the
things this project will be applied to. In addition to "hello", there's also "program", "computer", "phone", and "internet". Here's a
sentence that uses some of them: "My computer and phone can both access the internet".

Above, I've repeated "hello" a few times, so it is likely to now be included in the vocabulary. However, there may be
similar words that don't appear frequently in the training data. As such, while designing the model, we should be sure that
unknown words (like "hello") are preserved.

It would also be nice if "Joplin" was common enough to be included in the model's vocabulary. This would help ensure that the
model knows to properly capitalize it. I'm listing "Joplin" several times here as part of an effort to make this happen:
Joplin Desktop, Joplin Mobile, Joplin CLI, Joplin Web, Joplin's documentation, Joplin notebook, Joplin note, Joplin's editor, Joplin,
and Joplin.

Before deploying the model, it will be important to check for bias caused by its training data. For example, are certain pronouns and
honorifics over represented in the training data? Will the model understand "Mr. Name" but not "Ms. Name"?

I'm repeating the above text to emphasize it in the training data. This should offset some of the other sources, but runs the risk of
biasing the model towards my own writing.

This document's goal is to provide a small amount of additional data for fine-tuning the model.

Rationale: The majority of the model's data is from the 1800s and early 1900s. As such, the
lexicon and grammar employed by the model are somewhat archaic (to-do: find an archaic synonym
for "somewhat").

For example, the model should be able to employ the term "Joplin" in various forms. E.g. by reading
"Joplin's GUI differs significantly between its React Native Android app and its Windows app" and
inserting punctuation appropriately.

Joplin Desktop, Joplin Mobile, Joplin CLI, Joplin Web, Joplin's documentation, Joplin notebook, Joplin note, Joplin's editor, Joplin,
and Joplin.

Before deploying the model, it will be important to check for bias caused by its training data. For example, are certain pronouns and
honorifics over represented in the training data? Will the model understand "Mr. Name" but not "Ms. Name"?

I'm repeating the above text to emphasize it in the training data. This should offset some of the other sources, but runs the risk of
biasing the model towards my own writing.

This document's goal is to provide a small amount of additional data for fine-tuning the model.

Rationale: The majority of the model's data is from the 1800s and early 1900s. As such, the
lexicon and grammar employed by the model are somewhat archaic (to-do: find an archaic synonym
for "somewhat").

For example, the model should be able to employ the term "Joplin" in various forms. E.g. by reading
"Joplin's GUI differs significantly between its React Native Android app and its Windows app" and
inserting punctuation appropriately.

Unfortunately, this file is likely to have little or no effect: It's very short compared to the other
documents in the training corpus, it only mentions the relevant terms a few times, and may occasionally
be included in the validation set, rather than the training set.

Here's the main text of the document:

Joplin is a note-taking and to-do application that supports Windows, Linux, iOS, Android, web, and other platforms.
Its iOS, Android, and web platforms were written using React Native. Its Windows, Linux, and MacOS apps
use Electron.

Electron is an interesting word. Usually, it's lowercase (e.g. "electron"). However, in some cases, it
should be uppercase (e.g. "Electron"). I'm curious - will the model be intelligent enough to recognize,
from context, which "electron" is being referred to?

I'm also curious how well the model will handle question punctuation. Will it be different in English and
French? The same? It's hard to say.

Here are a few sample questions:

Why is this program not working? Why are my sentences not properly punctuated? Why doesn't it properly punctuate the word "I'm"?

I am testing this application. Does it work?

What about names? Are names capitalized correctly? These are names: Bob, Canada, Greenland, Eve, Edward, Alice,
and Jabberwocky. Does it convert them correctly?

How about conjunctions? This is in the training data, so I'm including the conjunctions in sentences. This paragraph has a few: Haven't
you punctuated this sentence? She'll punctuate this sentence. They'll do something. I'm editing this file with a text editor. It's
adding the letters I type to the screen.

Though not present in much of the training data, common abbreviations should also be handled. Here are some: CPU, TPU, USA, EU, IRS, SEC, JS, TS, and RNN. The last one, RNN, stands for "Recurrent Neural Network".

On the topic of training data, many of the documents incorporated thus far are very old. As a result, they have long sentences with many commas.
I'm curious whether any modern texts could be incorporated. Doing so could improve the model's accuracy.

While preparing the training data, I've observed that the word "hello" is rather uncommon. It isn't
even included in the list of the 10,000 most common words! I expect "hello" to be more common in spoken text, which is one of the
things this project will be applied to. In addition to "hello", there's also "program", "computer", "phone", and "internet". Here's a
sentence that uses some of them: "My computer and phone can both access the internet".

Above, I've repeated "hello" a few times, so it is likely to now be included in the vocabulary. However, there may be
similar words that don't appear frequently in the training data. As such, while designing the model, we should be sure that
unknown words (like "hello") are preserved.

Though not present in much of the training data, common abbreviations should also be handled. Here are some: CPU, TPU, USA, EU, IRS, SEC, JS, TS, and RNN. The last one, RNN, stands for "Recurrent Neural Network".

On the topic of training data, many of the documents incorporated thus far are very old. As a result, they have long sentences with many commas.
I'm curious whether any modern texts could be incorporated. Doing so could improve the model's accuracy.

While preparing the training data, I've observed that the word "hello" is rather uncommon. It isn't
even included in the list of the 10,000 most common words! I expect "hello" to be more common in spoken text, which is one of the
things this project will be applied to. In addition to "hello", there's also "program", "computer", "phone", and "internet". Here's a
sentence that uses some of them: "My computer and phone can both access the internet".

Above, I've repeated "hello" a few times, so it is likely to now be included in the vocabulary. However, there may be
similar words that don't appear frequently in the training data. As such, while designing the model, we should be sure that
unknown words (like "hello") are preserved.

It would also be nice if "Joplin" was common enough to be included in the model's vocabulary. This would help ensure that the
model knows to properly capitalize it. I'm listing "Joplin" several times here as part of an effort to make this happen:
Joplin Desktop, Joplin Mobile, Joplin CLI, Joplin Web, Joplin's documentation, Joplin notebook, Joplin note, Joplin's editor, Joplin,
and Joplin.

Before deploying the model, it will be important to check for bias caused by its training data. For example, are certain pronouns and
honorifics over represented in the training data? Will the model understand "Mr. Name" but not "Ms. Name"?

I'm repeating the above text to emphasize it in the training data. This should offset some of the other sources, but runs the risk of
biasing the model towards my own writing.

This document's goal is to provide a small amount of additional data for fine-tuning the model.

Rationale: The majority of the model's data is from the 1800s and early 1900s. As such, the
lexicon and grammar employed by the model are somewhat archaic (to-do: find an archaic synonym
for "somewhat").

For example, the model should be able to employ the term "Joplin" in various forms. E.g. by reading
"Joplin's GUI differs significantly between its React Native Android app and its Windows app" and
inserting punctuation appropriately.

Unfortunately, this file is likely to have little or no effect: It's very short compared to the other
documents in the training corpus, it only mentions the relevant terms a few times, and may occasionally
be included in the validation set, rather than the training set.

Here's the main text of the document:

Joplin is a note-taking and to-do application that supports Windows, Linux, iOS, Android, web, and other platforms.
Its iOS, Android, and web platforms were written using React Native. Its Windows, Linux, and MacOS apps
use Electron.

Electron is an interesting word. Usually, it's lowercase (e.g. "electron"). However, in some cases, it
should be uppercase (e.g. "Electron"). I'm curious - will the model be intelligent enough to recognize,
from context, which "electron" is being referred to?

I'm also curious how well the model will handle question punctuation. Will it be different in English and
French? The same? It's hard to say.

Here are a few sample questions:

Why is this program not working? Why are my sentences not properly punctuated? Why doesn't it properly punctuate the word "I'm"?

I am testing this application. Does it work?

What about names? Are names capitalized correctly? These are names: Bob, Canada, Greenland, Eve, Edward, Alice,
and Jabberwocky. Does it convert them correctly?

How about conjunctions? This is in the training data, so I'm including the conjunctions in sentences. This paragraph has a few: Haven't

Its iOS, Android, and web platforms were written using React Native. Its Windows, Linux, and MacOS apps
use Electron.

Electron is an interesting word. Usually, it's lowercase (e.g. "electron"). However, in some cases, it
should be uppercase (e.g. "Electron"). I'm curious - will the model be intelligent enough to recognize,
from context, which "electron" is being referred to?

I'm also curious how well the model will handle question punctuation. Will it be different in English and
French? The same? It's hard to say.

Here are a few sample questions:

Why is this program not working? Why are my sentences not properly punctuated? Why doesn't it properly punctuate the word "I'm"?

I am testing this application. Does it work?

What about names? Are names capitalized correctly? These are names: Bob, Canada, Greenland, Eve, Edward, Alice,
and Jabberwocky. Does it convert them correctly?

How about conjunctions? This is in the training data, so I'm including the conjunctions in sentences. This paragraph has a few: Haven't
you punctuated this sentence? She'll punctuate this sentence. They'll do something. I'm editing this file with a text editor. It's
adding the letters I type to the screen.

Though not present in much of the training data, common abbreviations should also be handled. Here are some: CPU, TPU, USA, EU, IRS, SEC, JS, TS, and RNN. The last one, RNN, stands for "Recurrent Neural Network".

On the topic of training data, many of the documents incorporated thus far are very old. As a result, they have long sentences with many commas.
I'm curious whether any modern texts could be incorporated. Doing so could improve the model's accuracy.

While preparing the training data, I've observed that the word "hello" is rather uncommon. It isn't
even included in the list of the 10,000 most common words! I expect "hello" to be more common in spoken text, which is one of the
things this project will be applied to. In addition to "hello", there's also "program", "computer", "phone", and "internet". Here's a
sentence that uses some of them: "My computer and phone can both access the internet".

Above, I've repeated "hello" a few times, so it is likely to now be included in the vocabulary. However, there may be
similar words that don't appear frequently in the training data. As such, while designing the model, we should be sure that
unknown words (like "hello") are preserved.

It would also be nice if "Joplin" was common enough to be included in the model's vocabulary. This would help ensure that the
model knows to properly capitalize it. I'm listing "Joplin" several times here as part of an effort to make this happen:
Joplin Desktop, Joplin Mobile, Joplin CLI, Joplin Web, Joplin's documentation, Joplin notebook, Joplin note, Joplin's editor, Joplin,
and Joplin.

Before deploying the model, it will be important to check for bias caused by its training data. For example, are certain pronouns and
honorifics over represented in the training data? Will the model understand "Mr. Name" but not "Ms. Name"?

I'm repeating the above text to emphasize it in the training data. This should offset some of the other sources, but runs the risk of
biasing the model towards my own writing.

This document's goal is to provide a small amount of additional data for fine-tuning the model.

Rationale: The majority of the model's data is from the 1800s and early 1900s. As such, the
lexicon and grammar employed by the model are somewhat archaic (to-do: find an archaic synonym
for "somewhat").

For example, the model should be able to employ the term "Joplin" in various forms. E.g. by reading
"Joplin's GUI differs significantly between its React Native Android app and its Windows app" and
inserting punctuation appropriately.

Unfortunately, this file is likely to have little or no effect: It's very short compared to the other
documents in the training corpus, it only mentions the relevant terms a few times, and may occasionally
be included in the validation set, rather than the training set.

honorifics over represented in the training data? Will the model understand "Mr. Name" but not "Ms. Name"?

I'm repeating the above text to emphasize it in the training data. This should offset some of the other sources, but runs the risk of
biasing the model towards my own writing.

This document's goal is to provide a small amount of additional data for fine-tuning the model.

Rationale: The majority of the model's data is from the 1800s and early 1900s. As such, the
lexicon and grammar employed by the model are somewhat archaic (to-do: find an archaic synonym
for "somewhat").

For example, the model should be able to employ the term "Joplin" in various forms. E.g. by reading
"Joplin's GUI differs significantly between its React Native Android app and its Windows app" and
inserting punctuation appropriately.

Unfortunately, this file is likely to have little or no effect: It's very short compared to the other
documents in the training corpus, it only mentions the relevant terms a few times, and may occasionally
be included in the validation set, rather than the training set.

Here's the main text of the document:

Joplin is a note-taking and to-do application that supports Windows, Linux, iOS, Android, web, and other platforms.
Its iOS, Android, and web platforms were written using React Native. Its Windows, Linux, and MacOS apps
use Electron.

Electron is an interesting word. Usually, it's lowercase (e.g. "electron"). However, in some cases, it
should be uppercase (e.g. "Electron"). I'm curious - will the model be intelligent enough to recognize,
from context, which "electron" is being referred to?

I'm also curious how well the model will handle question punctuation. Will it be different in English and
French? The same? It's hard to say.

Here are a few sample questions:

Why is this program not working? Why are my sentences not properly punctuated? Why doesn't it properly punctuate the word "I'm"?

I am testing this application. Does it work?

What about names? Are names capitalized correctly? These are names: Bob, Canada, Greenland, Eve, Edward, Alice,
and Jabberwocky. Does it convert them correctly?

How about conjunctions? This is in the training data, so I'm including the conjunctions in sentences. This paragraph has a few: Haven't
you punctuated this sentence? She'll punctuate this sentence. They'll do something. I'm editing this file with a text editor. It's
adding the letters I type to the screen.

Though not present in much of the training data, common abbreviations should also be handled. Here are some: CPU, TPU, USA, EU, IRS, SEC, JS, TS, and RNN. The last one, RNN, stands for "Recurrent Neural Network".

On the topic of training data, many of the documents incorporated thus far are very old. As a result, they have long sentences with many commas.
I'm curious whether any modern texts could be incorporated. Doing so could improve the model's accuracy.

While preparing the training data, I've observed that the word "hello" is rather uncommon. It isn't
even included in the list of the 10,000 most common words! I expect "hello" to be more common in spoken text, which is one of the
things this project will be applied to. In addition to "hello", there's also "program", "computer", "phone", and "internet". Here's a
sentence that uses some of them: "My computer and phone can both access the internet".

Above, I've repeated "hello" a few times, so it is likely to now be included in the vocabulary. However, there may be
similar words that don't appear frequently in the training data. As such, while designing the model, we should be sure that
unknown words (like "hello") are preserved.

It would also be nice if "Joplin" was common enough to be included in the model's vocabulary. This would help ensure that the
model knows to properly capitalize it. I'm listing "Joplin" several times here as part of an effort to make this happen:
Joplin Desktop, Joplin Mobile, Joplin CLI, Joplin Web, Joplin's documentation, Joplin notebook, Joplin note, Joplin's editor, Joplin,

even included in the list of the 10,000 most common words! I expect "hello" to be more common in spoken text, which is one of the
things this project will be applied to. In addition to "hello", there's also "program", "computer", "phone", and "internet". Here's a
sentence that uses some of them: "My computer and phone can both access the internet".

Above, I've repeated "hello" a few times, so it is likely to now be included in the vocabulary. However, there may be
similar words that don't appear frequently in the training data. As such, while designing the model, we should be sure that
unknown words (like "hello") are preserved.

It would also be nice if "Joplin" was common enough to be included in the model's vocabulary. This would help ensure that the
model knows to properly capitalize it. I'm listing "Joplin" several times here as part of an effort to make this happen:
Joplin Desktop, Joplin Mobile, Joplin CLI, Joplin Web, Joplin's documentation, Joplin notebook, Joplin note, Joplin's editor, Joplin,
and Joplin.

Before deploying the model, it will be important to check for bias caused by its training data. For example, are certain pronouns and
honorifics over represented in the training data? Will the model understand "Mr. Name" but not "Ms. Name"?

I'm repeating the above text to emphasize it in the training data. This should offset some of the other sources, but runs the risk of
biasing the model towards my own writing.

This document's goal is to provide a small amount of additional data for fine-tuning the model.

Rationale: The majority of the model's data is from the 1800s and early 1900s. As such, the
lexicon and grammar employed by the model are somewhat archaic (to-do: find an archaic synonym
for "somewhat").

For example, the model should be able to employ the term "Joplin" in various forms. E.g. by reading
"Joplin's GUI differs significantly between its React Native Android app and its Windows app" and
inserting punctuation appropriately.

Unfortunately, this file is likely to have little or no effect: It's very short compared to the other
documents in the training corpus, it only mentions the relevant terms a few times, and may occasionally
be included in the validation set, rather than the training set.

Here's the main text of the document:

Joplin is a note-taking and to-do application that supports Windows, Linux, iOS, Android, web, and other platforms.
Its iOS, Android, and web platforms were written using React Native. Its Windows, Linux, and MacOS apps
use Electron.

Electron is an interesting word. Usually, it's lowercase (e.g. "electron"). However, in some cases, it
should be uppercase (e.g. "Electron"). I'm curious - will the model be intelligent enough to recognize,
from context, which "electron" is being referred to?

I'm also curious how well the model will handle question punctuation. Will it be different in English and
French? The same? It's hard to say.

Here are a few sample questions:

Why is this program not working? Why are my sentences not properly punctuated? Why doesn't it properly punctuate the word "I'm"?

I am testing this application. Does it work?

What about names? Are names capitalized correctly? These are names: Bob, Canada, Greenland, Eve, Edward, Alice,
and Jabberwocky. Does it convert them correctly?

How about conjunctions? This is in the training data, so I'm including the conjunctions in sentences. This paragraph has a few: Haven't
you punctuated this sentence? She'll punctuate this sentence. They'll do something. I'm editing this file with a text editor. It's
adding the letters I type to the screen.

Though not present in much of the training data, common abbreviations should also be handled. Here are some: CPU, TPU, USA, EU, IRS, SEC, JS, TS, and RNN. The last one, RNN, stands for "Recurrent Neural Network".

On the topic of training data, many of the documents incorporated thus far are very old. As a result, they have long sentences with many commas.

Here are a few sample questions:

Why is this program not working? Why are my sentences not properly punctuated? Why doesn't it properly punctuate the word "I'm"?

I am testing this application. Does it work?

What about names? Are names capitalized correctly? These are names: Bob, Canada, Greenland, Eve, Edward, Alice,
and Jabberwocky. Does it convert them correctly?

How about conjunctions? This is in the training data, so I'm including the conjunctions in sentences. This paragraph has a few: Haven't
you punctuated this sentence? She'll punctuate this sentence. They'll do something. I'm editing this file with a text editor. It's
adding the letters I type to the screen.

Though not present in much of the training data, common abbreviations should also be handled. Here are some: CPU, TPU, USA, EU, IRS, SEC, JS, TS, and RNN. The last one, RNN, stands for "Recurrent Neural Network".

On the topic of training data, many of the documents incorporated thus far are very old. As a result, they have long sentences with many commas.
I'm curious whether any modern texts could be incorporated. Doing so could improve the model's accuracy.

While preparing the training data, I've observed that the word "hello" is rather uncommon. It isn't
even included in the list of the 10,000 most common words! I expect "hello" to be more common in spoken text, which is one of the
things this project will be applied to. In addition to "hello", there's also "program", "computer", "phone", and "internet". Here's a
sentence that uses some of them: "My computer and phone can both access the internet".

Above, I've repeated "hello" a few times, so it is likely to now be included in the vocabulary. However, there may be
similar words that don't appear frequently in the training data. As such, while designing the model, we should be sure that
unknown words (like "hello") are preserved.

It would also be nice if "Joplin" was common enough to be included in the model's vocabulary. This would help ensure that the
model knows to properly capitalize it. I'm listing "Joplin" several times here as part of an effort to make this happen:
Joplin Desktop, Joplin Mobile, Joplin CLI, Joplin Web, Joplin's documentation, Joplin notebook, Joplin note, Joplin's editor, Joplin,
and Joplin.

Before deploying the model, it will be important to check for bias caused by its training data. For example, are certain pronouns and
honorifics over represented in the training data? Will the model understand "Mr. Name" but not "Ms. Name"?

I'm repeating the above text to emphasize it in the training data. This should offset some of the other sources, but runs the risk of
biasing the model towards my own writing.

This document's goal is to provide a small amount of additional data for fine-tuning the model.

Rationale: The majority of the model's data is from the 1800s and early 1900s. As such, the
lexicon and grammar employed by the model are somewhat archaic (to-do: find an archaic synonym
for "somewhat").

For example, the model should be able to employ the term "Joplin" in various forms. E.g. by reading
"Joplin's GUI differs significantly between its React Native Android app and its Windows app" and
inserting punctuation appropriately.

Unfortunately, this file is likely to have little or no effect: It's very short compared to the other
documents in the training corpus, it only mentions the relevant terms a few times, and may occasionally
be included in the validation set, rather than the training set.

Here's the main text of the document:

Joplin is a note-taking and to-do application that supports Windows, Linux, iOS, Android, web, and other platforms.

use Electron.

Electron is an interesting word. Usually, it's lowercase (e.g. "electron"). However, in some cases, it
should be uppercase (e.g. "Electron"). I'm curious - will the model be intelligent enough to recognize,
from context, which "electron" is being referred to?

For example, the model should be able to employ the term "Joplin" in various forms. E.g. by reading
"Joplin's GUI differs significantly between its React Native Android app and its Windows app" and
inserting punctuation appropriately.

Unfortunately, this file is likely to have little or no effect: It's very short compared to the other
documents in the training corpus, it only mentions the relevant terms a few times, and may occasionally
be included in the validation set, rather than the training set.

Here's the main text of the document:

Joplin is a note-taking and to-do application that supports Windows, Linux, iOS, Android, web, and other platforms.
Its iOS, Android, and web platforms were written using React Native. Its Windows, Linux, and MacOS apps
use Electron.

Electron is an interesting word. Usually, it's lowercase (e.g. "electron"). However, in some cases, it
should be uppercase (e.g. "Electron"). I'm curious - will the model be intelligent enough to recognize,
from context, which "electron" is being referred to?

I'm also curious how well the model will handle question punctuation. Will it be different in English and
French? The same? It's hard to say.

Here are a few sample questions:

Why is this program not working? Why are my sentences not properly punctuated? Why doesn't it properly punctuate the word "I'm"?

I am testing this application. Does it work?

What about names? Are names capitalized correctly? These are names: Bob, Canada, Greenland, Eve, Edward, Alice,
and Jabberwocky. Does it convert them correctly?

How about conjunctions? This is in the training data, so I'm including the conjunctions in sentences. This paragraph has a few: Haven't
you punctuated this sentence? She'll punctuate this sentence. They'll do something. I'm editing this file with a text editor. It's
adding the letters I type to the screen.

Though not present in much of the training data, common abbreviations should also be handled. Here are some: CPU, TPU, USA, EU, IRS, SEC, JS, TS, and RNN. The last one, RNN, stands for "Recurrent Neural Network".

On the topic of training data, many of the documents incorporated thus far are very old. As a result, they have long sentences with many commas.
I'm curious whether any modern texts could be incorporated. Doing so could improve the model's accuracy.

While preparing the training data, I've observed that the word "hello" is rather uncommon. It isn't
even included in the list of the 10,000 most common words! I expect "hello" to be more common in spoken text, which is one of the
things this project will be applied to. In addition to "hello", there's also "program", "computer", "phone", and "internet". Here's a
sentence that uses some of them: "My computer and phone can both access the internet".

Above, I've repeated "hello" a few times, so it is likely to now be included in the vocabulary. However, there may be
similar words that don't appear frequently in the training data. As such, while designing the model, we should be sure that
unknown words (like "hello") are preserved.

It would also be nice if "Joplin" was common enough to be included in the model's vocabulary. This would help ensure that the
model knows to properly capitalize it. I'm listing "Joplin" several times here as part of an effort to make this happen:
Joplin Desktop, Joplin Mobile, Joplin CLI, Joplin Web, Joplin's documentation, Joplin notebook, Joplin note, Joplin's editor, Joplin,
and Joplin.

Before deploying the model, it will be important to check for bias caused by its training data. For example, are certain pronouns and
honorifics over represented in the training data? Will the model understand "Mr. Name" but not "Ms. Name"?

I'm repeating the above text to emphasize it in the training data. This should offset some of the other sources, but runs the risk of
biasing the model towards my own writing.

This document's goal is to provide a small amount of additional data for fine-tuning the model.

Rationale: The majority of the model's data is from the 1800s and early 1900s. As such, the
lexicon and grammar employed by the model are somewhat archaic (to-do: find an archaic synonym
for "somewhat").

unknown words (like "hello") are preserved.

It would also be nice if "Joplin" was common enough to be included in the model's vocabulary. This would help ensure that the
model knows to properly capitalize it. I'm listing "Joplin" several times here as part of an effort to make this happen:
Joplin Desktop, Joplin Mobile, Joplin CLI, Joplin Web, Joplin's documentation, Joplin notebook, Joplin note, Joplin's editor, Joplin,
and Joplin.

Before deploying the model, it will be important to check for bias caused by its training data. For example, are certain pronouns and
honorifics over represented in the training data? Will the model understand "Mr. Name" but not "Ms. Name"?

I'm repeating the above text to emphasize it in the training data. This should offset some of the other sources, but runs the risk of
biasing the model towards my own writing.

This document's goal is to provide a small amount of additional data for fine-tuning the model.

Rationale: The majority of the model's data is from the 1800s and early 1900s. As such, the
lexicon and grammar employed by the model are somewhat archaic (to-do: find an archaic synonym
for "somewhat").

For example, the model should be able to employ the term "Joplin" in various forms. E.g. by reading
"Joplin's GUI differs significantly between its React Native Android app and its Windows app" and
inserting punctuation appropriately.

Unfortunately, this file is likely to have little or no effect: It's very short compared to the other
documents in the training corpus, it only mentions the relevant terms a few times, and may occasionally
be included in the validation set, rather than the training set.

Here's the main text of the document:

Joplin is a note-taking and to-do application that supports Windows, Linux, iOS, Android, web, and other platforms.
Its iOS, Android, and web platforms were written using React Native. Its Windows, Linux, and MacOS apps
use Electron.

Electron is an interesting word. Usually, it's lowercase (e.g. "electron"). However, in some cases, it
should be uppercase (e.g. "Electron"). I'm curious - will the model be intelligent enough to recognize,
from context, which "electron" is being referred to?

I'm also curious how well the model will handle question punctuation. Will it be different in English and
French? The same? It's hard to say.

Here are a few sample questions:

Why is this program not working? Why are my sentences not properly punctuated? Why doesn't it properly punctuate the word "I'm"?

I am testing this application. Does it work?

What about names? Are names capitalized correctly? These are names: Bob, Canada, Greenland, Eve, Edward, Alice,
and Jabberwocky. Does it convert them correctly?

How about conjunctions? This is in the training data, so I'm including the conjunctions in sentences. This paragraph has a few: Haven't
you punctuated this sentence? She'll punctuate this sentence. They'll do something. I'm editing this file with a text editor. It's
adding the letters I type to the screen.

Though not present in much of the training data, common abbreviations should also be handled. Here are some: CPU, TPU, USA, EU, IRS, SEC, JS, TS, and RNN. The last one, RNN, stands for "Recurrent Neural Network".

On the topic of training data, many of the documents incorporated thus far are very old. As a result, they have long sentences with many commas.
I'm curious whether any modern texts could be incorporated. Doing so could improve the model's accuracy.

While preparing the training data, I've observed that the word "hello" is rather uncommon. It isn't
even included in the list of the 10,000 most common words! I expect "hello" to be more common in spoken text, which is one of the
things this project will be applied to. In addition to "hello", there's also "program", "computer", "phone", and "internet". Here's a
sentence that uses some of them: "My computer and phone can both access the internet".

Above, I've repeated "hello" a few times, so it is likely to now be included in the vocabulary. However, there may be

you punctuated this sentence? She'll punctuate this sentence. They'll do something. I'm editing this file with a text editor. It's
adding the letters I type to the screen.

Though not present in much of the training data, common abbreviations should also be handled. Here are some: CPU, TPU, USA, EU, IRS, SEC, JS, TS, and RNN. The last one, RNN, stands for "Recurrent Neural Network".

On the topic of training data, many of the documents incorporated thus far are very old. As a result, they have long sentences with many commas.
I'm curious whether any modern texts could be incorporated. Doing so could improve the model's accuracy.

While preparing the training data, I've observed that the word "hello" is rather uncommon. It isn't
even included in the list of the 10,000 most common words! I expect "hello" to be more common in spoken text, which is one of the
things this project will be applied to. In addition to "hello", there's also "program", "computer", "phone", and "internet". Here's a
sentence that uses some of them: "My computer and phone can both access the internet".

Above, I've repeated "hello" a few times, so it is likely to now be included in the vocabulary. However, there may be
similar words that don't appear frequently in the training data. As such, while designing the model, we should be sure that
unknown words (like "hello") are preserved.

It would also be nice if "Joplin" was common enough to be included in the model's vocabulary. This would help ensure that the
model knows to properly capitalize it. I'm listing "Joplin" several times here as part of an effort to make this happen:
Joplin Desktop, Joplin Mobile, Joplin CLI, Joplin Web, Joplin's documentation, Joplin notebook, Joplin note, Joplin's editor, Joplin,
and Joplin.

Before deploying the model, it will be important to check for bias caused by its training data. For example, are certain pronouns and
honorifics over represented in the training data? Will the model understand "Mr. Name" but not "Ms. Name"?

I'm repeating the above text to emphasize it in the training data. This should offset some of the other sources, but runs the risk of
biasing the model towards my own writing.

This document's goal is to provide a small amount of additional data for fine-tuning the model.

Rationale: The majority of the model's data is from the 1800s and early 1900s. As such, the
lexicon and grammar employed by the model are somewhat archaic (to-do: find an archaic synonym
for "somewhat").

For example, the model should be able to employ the term "Joplin" in various forms. E.g. by reading
"Joplin's GUI differs significantly between its React Native Android app and its Windows app" and
inserting punctuation appropriately.

Unfortunately, this file is likely to have little or no effect: It's very short compared to the other
documents in the training corpus, it only mentions the relevant terms a few times, and may occasionally
be included in the validation set, rather than the training set.

Here's the main text of the document:

Joplin is a note-taking and to-do application that supports Windows, Linux, iOS, Android, web, and other platforms.
Its iOS, Android, and web platforms were written using React Native. Its Windows, Linux, and MacOS apps
use Electron.

Electron is an interesting word. Usually, it's lowercase (e.g. "electron"). However, in some cases, it
should be uppercase (e.g. "Electron"). I'm curious - will the model be intelligent enough to recognize,
from context, which "electron" is being referred to?

I'm also curious how well the model will handle question punctuation. Will it be different in English and
French? The same? It's hard to say.

Here are a few sample questions:

Why is this program not working? Why are my sentences not properly punctuated? Why doesn't it properly punctuate the word "I'm"?

I am testing this application. Does it work?

What about names? Are names capitalized correctly? These are names: Bob, Canada, Greenland, Eve, Edward, Alice,
and Jabberwocky. Does it convert them correctly?

be included in the validation set, rather than the training set.

Here's the main text of the document:

Joplin is a note-taking and to-do application that supports Windows, Linux, iOS, Android, web, and other platforms.
Its iOS, Android, and web platforms were written using React Native. Its Windows, Linux, and MacOS apps
use Electron.

Electron is an interesting word. Usually, it's lowercase (e.g. "electron"). However, in some cases, it
should be uppercase (e.g. "Electron"). I'm curious - will the model be intelligent enough to recognize,
from context, which "electron" is being referred to?

I'm also curious how well the model will handle question punctuation. Will it be different in English and
French? The same? It's hard to say.

Here are a few sample questions:

Why is this program not working? Why are my sentences not properly punctuated? Why doesn't it properly punctuate the word "I'm"?

I am testing this application. Does it work?

What about names? Are names capitalized correctly? These are names: Bob, Canada, Greenland, Eve, Edward, Alice,
and Jabberwocky. Does it convert them correctly?

How about conjunctions? This is in the training data, so I'm including the conjunctions in sentences. This paragraph has a few: Haven't
you punctuated this sentence? She'll punctuate this sentence. They'll do something. I'm editing this file with a text editor. It's
adding the letters I type to the screen.

Though not present in much of the training data, common abbreviations should also be handled. Here are some: CPU, TPU, USA, EU, IRS, SEC, JS, TS, and RNN. The last one, RNN, stands for "Recurrent Neural Network".

On the topic of training data, many of the documents incorporated thus far are very old. As a result, they have long sentences with many commas.
I'm curious whether any modern texts could be incorporated. Doing so could improve the model's accuracy.

While preparing the training data, I've observed that the word "hello" is rather uncommon. It isn't
even included in the list of the 10,000 most common words! I expect "hello" to be more common in spoken text, which is one of the
things this project will be applied to. In addition to "hello", there's also "program", "computer", "phone", and "internet". Here's a
sentence that uses some of them: "My computer and phone can both access the internet".

Above, I've repeated "hello" a few times, so it is likely to now be included in the vocabulary. However, there may be
similar words that don't appear frequently in the training data. As such, while designing the model, we should be sure that
unknown words (like "hello") are preserved.

It would also be nice if "Joplin" was common enough to be included in the model's vocabulary. This would help ensure that the
model knows to properly capitalize it. I'm listing "Joplin" several times here as part of an effort to make this happen:
Joplin Desktop, Joplin Mobile, Joplin CLI, Joplin Web, Joplin's documentation, Joplin notebook, Joplin note, Joplin's editor, Joplin,
and Joplin.

Before deploying the model, it will be important to check for bias caused by its training data. For example, are certain pronouns and
honorifics over represented in the training data? Will the model understand "Mr. Name" but not "Ms. Name"?

I'm repeating the above text to emphasize it in the training data. This should offset some of the other sources, but runs the risk of
biasing the model towards my own writing.

This document's goal is to provide a small amount of additional data for fine-tuning the model.

Rationale: The majority of the model's data is from the 1800s and early 1900s. As such, the
lexicon and grammar employed by the model are somewhat archaic (to-do: find an archaic synonym
for "somewhat").

For example, the model should be able to employ the term "Joplin" in various forms. E.g. by reading
"Joplin's GUI differs significantly between its React Native Android app and its Windows app" and
inserting punctuation appropriately.

Joplin Desktop, Joplin Mobile, Joplin CLI, Joplin Web, Joplin's documentation, Joplin notebook, Joplin note, Joplin's editor, Joplin,
and Joplin.

Before deploying the model, it will be important to check for bias caused by its training data. For example, are certain pronouns and
honorifics over represented in the training data? Will the model understand "Mr. Name" but not "Ms. Name"?

I'm repeating the above text to emphasize it in the training data. This should offset some of the other sources, but runs the risk of
biasing the model towards my own writing.

This document's goal is to provide a small amount of additional data for fine-tuning the model.

Rationale: The majority of the model's data is from the 1800s and early 1900s. As such, the
lexicon and grammar employed by the model are somewhat archaic (to-do: find an archaic synonym
for "somewhat").

For example, the model should be able to employ the term "Joplin" in various forms. E.g. by reading
"Joplin's GUI differs significantly between its React Native Android app and its Windows app" and
inserting punctuation appropriately.

Unfortunately, this file is likely to have little or no effect: It's very short compared to the other
documents in the training corpus, it only mentions the relevant terms a few times, and may occasionally
be included in the validation set, rather than the training set.

Here's the main text of the document:

Joplin is a note-taking and to-do application that supports Windows, Linux, iOS, Android, web, and other platforms.
Its iOS, Android, and web platforms were written using React Native. Its Windows, Linux, and MacOS apps
use Electron.

Electron is an interesting word. Usually, it's lowercase (e.g. "electron"). However, in some cases, it
should be uppercase (e.g. "Electron"). I'm curious - will the model be intelligent enough to recognize,
from context, which "electron" is being referred to?

I'm also curious how well the model will handle question punctuation. Will it be different in English and
French? The same? It's hard to say.

Here are a few sample questions:

Why is this program not working? Why are my sentences not properly punctuated? Why doesn't it properly punctuate the word "I'm"?

I am testing this application. Does it work?

What about names? Are names capitalized correctly? These are names: Bob, Canada, Greenland, Eve, Edward, Alice,
and Jabberwocky. Does it convert them correctly?

How about conjunctions? This is in the training data, so I'm including the conjunctions in sentences. This paragraph has a few: Haven't
you punctuated this sentence? She'll punctuate this sentence. They'll do something. I'm editing this file with a text editor. It's
adding the letters I type to the screen.

Though not present in much of the training data, common abbreviations should also be handled. Here are some: CPU, TPU, USA, EU, IRS, SEC, JS, TS, and RNN. The last one, RNN, stands for "Recurrent Neural Network".

On the topic of training data, many of the documents incorporated thus far are very old. As a result, they have long sentences with many commas.
I'm curious whether any modern texts could be incorporated. Doing so could improve the model's accuracy.

While preparing the training data, I've observed that the word "hello" is rather uncommon. It isn't
even included in the list of the 10,000 most common words! I expect "hello" to be more common in spoken text, which is one of the
things this project will be applied to. In addition to "hello", there's also "program", "computer", "phone", and "internet". Here's a
sentence that uses some of them: "My computer and phone can both access the internet".

Above, I've repeated "hello" a few times, so it is likely to now be included in the vocabulary. However, there may be
similar words that don't appear frequently in the training data. As such, while designing the model, we should be sure that
unknown words (like "hello") are preserved.

Though not present in much of the training data, common abbreviations should also be handled. Here are some: CPU, TPU, USA, EU, IRS, SEC, JS, TS, and RNN. The last one, RNN, stands for "Recurrent Neural Network".

On the topic of training data, many of the documents incorporated thus far are very old. As a result, they have long sentences with many commas.
I'm curious whether any modern texts could be incorporated. Doing so could improve the model's accuracy.

While preparing the training data, I've observed that the word "hello" is rather uncommon. It isn't
even included in the list of the 10,000 most common words! I expect "hello" to be more common in spoken text, which is one of the
things this project will be applied to. In addition to "hello", there's also "program", "computer", "phone", and "internet". Here's a
sentence that uses some of them: "My computer and phone can both access the internet".

Above, I've repeated "hello" a few times, so it is likely to now be included in the vocabulary. However, there may be
similar words that don't appear frequently in the training data. As such, while designing the model, we should be sure that
unknown words (like "hello") are preserved.

It would also be nice if "Joplin" was common enough to be included in the model's vocabulary. This would help ensure that the
model knows to properly capitalize it. I'm listing "Joplin" several times here as part of an effort to make this happen:
Joplin Desktop, Joplin Mobile, Joplin CLI, Joplin Web, Joplin's documentation, Joplin notebook, Joplin note, Joplin's editor, Joplin,
and Joplin.

Before deploying the model, it will be important to check for bias caused by its training data. For example, are certain pronouns and
honorifics over represented in the training data? Will the model understand "Mr. Name" but not "Ms. Name"?

I'm repeating the above text to emphasize it in the training data. This should offset some of the other sources, but runs the risk of
biasing the model towards my own writing.

This document's goal is to provide a small amount of additional data for fine-tuning the model.

Rationale: The majority of the model's data is from the 1800s and early 1900s. As such, the
lexicon and grammar employed by the model are somewhat archaic (to-do: find an archaic synonym
for "somewhat").

For example, the model should be able to employ the term "Joplin" in various forms. E.g. by reading
"Joplin's GUI differs significantly between its React Native Android app and its Windows app" and
inserting punctuation appropriately.

Unfortunately, this file is likely to have little or no effect: It's very short compared to the other
documents in the training corpus, it only mentions the relevant terms a few times, and may occasionally
be included in the validation set, rather than the training set.

Here's the main text of the document:

Joplin is a note-taking and to-do application that supports Windows, Linux, iOS, Android, web, and other platforms.
Its iOS, Android, and web platforms were written using React Native. Its Windows, Linux, and MacOS apps
use Electron.

Electron is an interesting word. Usually, it's lowercase (e.g. "electron"). However, in some cases, it
should be uppercase (e.g. "Electron"). I'm curious - will the model be intelligent enough to recognize,
from context, which "electron" is being referred to?

I'm also curious how well the model will handle question punctuation. Will it be different in English and
French? The same? It's hard to say.

Here are a few sample questions:

Why is this program not working? Why are my sentences not properly punctuated? Why doesn't it properly punctuate the word "I'm"?

I am testing this application. Does it work?

What about names? Are names capitalized correctly? These are names: Bob, Canada, Greenland, Eve, Edward, Alice,
and Jabberwocky. Does it convert them correctly?

How about conjunctions? This is in the training data, so I'm including the conjunctions in sentences. This paragraph has a few: Haven't

Its iOS, Android, and web platforms were written using React Native. Its Windows, Linux, and MacOS apps
use Electron.

Electron is an interesting word. Usually, it's lowercase (e.g. "electron"). However, in some cases, it
should be uppercase (e.g. "Electron"). I'm curious - will the model be intelligent enough to recognize,
from context, which "electron" is being referred to?

I'm also curious how well the model will handle question punctuation. Will it be different in English and
French? The same? It's hard to say.

Here are a few sample questions:

Why is this program not working? Why are my sentences not properly punctuated? Why doesn't it properly punctuate the word "I'm"?

I am testing this application. Does it work?

What about names? Are names capitalized correctly? These are names: Bob, Canada, Greenland, Eve, Edward, Alice,
and Jabberwocky. Does it convert them correctly?

How about conjunctions? This is in the training data, so I'm including the conjunctions in sentences. This paragraph has a few: Haven't
you punctuated this sentence? She'll punctuate this sentence. They'll do something. I'm editing this file with a text editor. It's
adding the letters I type to the screen.

Though not present in much of the training data, common abbreviations should also be handled. Here are some: CPU, TPU, USA, EU, IRS, SEC, JS, TS, and RNN. The last one, RNN, stands for "Recurrent Neural Network".

On the topic of training data, many of the documents incorporated thus far are very old. As a result, they have long sentences with many commas.
I'm curious whether any modern texts could be incorporated. Doing so could improve the model's accuracy.

While preparing the training data, I've observed that the word "hello" is rather uncommon. It isn't
even included in the list of the 10,000 most common words! I expect "hello" to be more common in spoken text, which is one of the
things this project will be applied to. In addition to "hello", there's also "program", "computer", "phone", and "internet". Here's a
sentence that uses some of them: "My computer and phone can both access the internet".

Above, I've repeated "hello" a few times, so it is likely to now be included in the vocabulary. However, there may be
similar words that don't appear frequently in the training data. As such, while designing the model, we should be sure that
unknown words (like "hello") are preserved.

It would also be nice if "Joplin" was common enough to be included in the model's vocabulary. This would help ensure that the
model knows to properly capitalize it. I'm listing "Joplin" several times here as part of an effort to make this happen:
Joplin Desktop, Joplin Mobile, Joplin CLI, Joplin Web, Joplin's documentation, Joplin notebook, Joplin note, Joplin's editor, Joplin,
and Joplin.

Before deploying the model, it will be important to check for bias caused by its training data. For example, are certain pronouns and
honorifics over represented in the training data? Will the model understand "Mr. Name" but not "Ms. Name"?

I'm repeating the above text to emphasize it in the training data. This should offset some of the other sources, but runs the risk of
biasing the model towards my own writing.

This document's goal is to provide a small amount of additional data for fine-tuning the model.

Rationale: The majority of the model's data is from the 1800s and early 1900s. As such, the
lexicon and grammar employed by the model are somewhat archaic (to-do: find an archaic synonym
for "somewhat").

For example, the model should be able to employ the term "Joplin" in various forms. E.g. by reading
"Joplin's GUI differs significantly between its React Native Android app and its Windows app" and
inserting punctuation appropriately.

Unfortunately, this file is likely to have little or no effect: It's very short compared to the other
documents in the training corpus, it only mentions the relevant terms a few times, and may occasionally
be included in the validation set, rather than the training set.

honorifics over represented in the training data? Will the model understand "Mr. Name" but not "Ms. Name"?

I'm repeating the above text to emphasize it in the training data. This should offset some of the other sources, but runs the risk of
biasing the model towards my own writing.

This document's goal is to provide a small amount of additional data for fine-tuning the model.

Rationale: The majority of the model's data is from the 1800s and early 1900s. As such, the
lexicon and grammar employed by the model are somewhat archaic (to-do: find an archaic synonym
for "somewhat").

For example, the model should be able to employ the term "Joplin" in various forms. E.g. by reading
"Joplin's GUI differs significantly between its React Native Android app and its Windows app" and
inserting punctuation appropriately.

Unfortunately, this file is likely to have little or no effect: It's very short compared to the other
documents in the training corpus, it only mentions the relevant terms a few times, and may occasionally
be included in the validation set, rather than the training set.

Here's the main text of the document:

Joplin is a note-taking and to-do application that supports Windows, Linux, iOS, Android, web, and other platforms.
Its iOS, Android, and web platforms were written using React Native. Its Windows, Linux, and MacOS apps
use Electron.

Electron is an interesting word. Usually, it's lowercase (e.g. "electron"). However, in some cases, it
should be uppercase (e.g. "Electron"). I'm curious - will the model be intelligent enough to recognize,
from context, which "electron" is being referred to?

I'm also curious how well the model will handle question punctuation. Will it be different in English and
French? The same? It's hard to say.

Here are a few sample questions:

Why is this program not working? Why are my sentences not properly punctuated? Why doesn't it properly punctuate the word "I'm"?

I am testing this application. Does it work?

What about names? Are names capitalized correctly? These are names: Bob, Canada, Greenland, Eve, Edward, Alice,
and Jabberwocky. Does it convert them correctly?

How about conjunctions? This is in the training data, so I'm including the conjunctions in sentences. This paragraph has a few: Haven't
you punctuated this sentence? She'll punctuate this sentence. They'll do something. I'm editing this file with a text editor. It's
adding the letters I type to the screen.

Though not present in much of the training data, common abbreviations should also be handled. Here are some: CPU, TPU, USA, EU, IRS, SEC, JS, TS, and RNN. The last one, RNN, stands for "Recurrent Neural Network".

On the topic of training data, many of the documents incorporated thus far are very old. As a result, they have long sentences with many commas.
I'm curious whether any modern texts could be incorporated. Doing so could improve the model's accuracy.

While preparing the training data, I've observed that the word "hello" is rather uncommon. It isn't
even included in the list of the 10,000 most common words! I expect "hello" to be more common in spoken text, which is one of the
things this project will be applied to. In addition to "hello", there's also "program", "computer", "phone", and "internet". Here's a
sentence that uses some of them: "My computer and phone can both access the internet".

Above, I've repeated "hello" a few times, so it is likely to now be included in the vocabulary. However, there may be
similar words that don't appear frequently in the training data. As such, while designing the model, we should be sure that
unknown words (like "hello") are preserved.

It would also be nice if "Joplin" was common enough to be included in the model's vocabulary. This would help ensure that the
model knows to properly capitalize it. I'm listing "Joplin" several times here as part of an effort to make this happen:
Joplin Desktop, Joplin Mobile, Joplin CLI, Joplin Web, Joplin's documentation, Joplin notebook, Joplin note, Joplin's editor, Joplin,

even included in the list of the 10,000 most common words! I expect "hello" to be more common in spoken text, which is one of the
things this project will be applied to. In addition to "hello", there's also "program", "computer", "phone", and "internet". Here's a
sentence that uses some of them: "My computer and phone can both access the internet".

Above, I've repeated "hello" a few times, so it is likely to now be included in the vocabulary. However, there may be
similar words that don't appear frequently in the training data. As such, while designing the model, we should be sure that
unknown words (like "hello") are preserved.

It would also be nice if "Joplin" was common enough to be included in the model's vocabulary. This would help ensure that the
model knows to properly capitalize it. I'm listing "Joplin" several times here as part of an effort to make this happen:
Joplin Desktop, Joplin Mobile, Joplin CLI, Joplin Web, Joplin's documentation, Joplin notebook, Joplin note, Joplin's editor, Joplin,
and Joplin.

Before deploying the model, it will be important to check for bias caused by its training data. For example, are certain pronouns and
honorifics over represented in the training data? Will the model understand "Mr. Name" but not "Ms. Name"?

I'm repeating the above text to emphasize it in the training data. This should offset some of the other sources, but runs the risk of
biasing the model towards my own writing.

This document's goal is to provide a small amount of additional data for fine-tuning the model.

Rationale: The majority of the model's data is from the 1800s and early 1900s. As such, the
lexicon and grammar employed by the model are somewhat archaic (to-do: find an archaic synonym
for "somewhat").

For example, the model should be able to employ the term "Joplin" in various forms. E.g. by reading
"Joplin's GUI differs significantly between its React Native Android app and its Windows app" and
inserting punctuation appropriately.

Unfortunately, this file is likely to have little or no effect: It's very short compared to the other
documents in the training corpus, it only mentions the relevant terms a few times, and may occasionally
be included in the validation set, rather than the training set.

Here's the main text of the document:

Joplin is a note-taking and to-do application that supports Windows, Linux, iOS, Android, web, and other platforms.
Its iOS, Android, and web platforms were written using React Native. Its Windows, Linux, and MacOS apps
use Electron.

Electron is an interesting word. Usually, it's lowercase (e.g. "electron"). However, in some cases, it
should be uppercase (e.g. "Electron"). I'm curious - will the model be intelligent enough to recognize,
from context, which "electron" is being referred to?

I'm also curious how well the model will handle question punctuation. Will it be different in English and
French? The same? It's hard to say.

Here are a few sample questions:

Why is this program not working? Why are my sentences not properly punctuated? Why doesn't it properly punctuate the word "I'm"?

I am testing this application. Does it work?

What about names? Are names capitalized correctly? These are names: Bob, Canada, Greenland, Eve, Edward, Alice,
and Jabberwocky. Does it convert them correctly?

How about conjunctions? This is in the training data, so I'm including the conjunctions in sentences. This paragraph has a few: Haven't
you punctuated this sentence? She'll punctuate this sentence. They'll do something. I'm editing this file with a text editor. It's
adding the letters I type to the screen.

Though not present in much of the training data, common abbreviations should also be handled. Here are some: CPU, TPU, USA, EU, IRS, SEC, JS, TS, and RNN. The last one, RNN, stands for "Recurrent Neural Network".

On the topic of training data, many of the documents incorporated thus far are very old. As a result, they have long sentences with many commas.

Here are a few sample questions:

Why is this program not working? Why are my sentences not properly punctuated? Why doesn't it properly punctuate the word "I'm"?

I am testing this application. Does it work?

What about names? Are names capitalized correctly? These are names: Bob, Canada, Greenland, Eve, Edward, Alice,
and Jabberwocky. Does it convert them correctly?

How about conjunctions? This is in the training data, so I'm including the conjunctions in sentences. This paragraph has a few: Haven't
you punctuated this sentence? She'll punctuate this sentence. They'll do something. I'm editing this file with a text editor. It's
adding the letters I type to the screen.

Though not present in much of the training data, common abbreviations should also be handled. Here are some: CPU, TPU, USA, EU, IRS, SEC, JS, TS, and RNN. The last one, RNN, stands for "Recurrent Neural Network".

On the topic of training data, many of the documents incorporated thus far are very old. As a result, they have long sentences with many commas.
I'm curious whether any modern texts could be incorporated. Doing so could improve the model's accuracy.

While preparing the training data, I've observed that the word "hello" is rather uncommon. It isn't
even included in the list of the 10,000 most common words! I expect "hello" to be more common in spoken text, which is one of the
things this project will be applied to. In addition to "hello", there's also "program", "computer", "phone", and "internet". Here's a
sentence that uses some of them: "My computer and phone can both access the internet".

Above, I've repeated "hello" a few times, so it is likely to now be included in the vocabulary. However, there may be
similar words that don't appear frequently in the training data. As such, while designing the model, we should be sure that
unknown words (like "hello") are preserved.

It would also be nice if "Joplin" was common enough to be included in the model's vocabulary. This would help ensure that the
model knows to properly capitalize it. I'm listing "Joplin" several times here as part of an effort to make this happen:
Joplin Desktop, Joplin Mobile, Joplin CLI, Joplin Web, Joplin's documentation, Joplin notebook, Joplin note, Joplin's editor, Joplin,
and Joplin.

Before deploying the model, it will be important to check for bias caused by its training data. For example, are certain pronouns and
honorifics over represented in the training data? Will the model understand "Mr. Name" but not "Ms. Name"?

I'm repeating the above text to emphasize it in the training data. This should offset some of the other sources, but runs the risk of
biasing the model towards my own writing.

This document's goal is to provide a small amount of additional data for fine-tuning the model.

Rationale: The majority of the model's data is from the 1800s and early 1900s. As such, the
lexicon and grammar employed by the model are somewhat archaic (to-do: find an archaic synonym
for "somewhat").

For example, the model should be able to employ the term "Joplin" in various forms. E.g. by reading
"Joplin's GUI differs significantly between its React Native Android app and its Windows app" and
inserting punctuation appropriately.

Unfortunately, this file is likely to have little or no effect: It's very short compared to the other
documents in the training corpus, it only mentions the relevant terms a few times, and may occasionally
be included in the validation set, rather than the training set.

Here's the main text of the document:

Joplin is a note-taking and to-do application that supports Windows, Linux, iOS, Android, web, and other platforms.

use Electron.

Electron is an interesting word. Usually, it's lowercase (e.g. "electron"). However, in some cases, it
should be uppercase (e.g. "Electron"). I'm curious - will the model be intelligent enough to recognize,
from context, which "electron" is being referred to?

For example, the model should be able to employ the term "Joplin" in various forms. E.g. by reading
"Joplin's GUI differs significantly between its React Native Android app and its Windows app" and
inserting punctuation appropriately.

Unfortunately, this file is likely to have little or no effect: It's very short compared to the other
documents in the training corpus, it only mentions the relevant terms a few times, and may occasionally
be included in the validation set, rather than the training set.

Here's the main text of the document:

Joplin is a note-taking and to-do application that supports Windows, Linux, iOS, Android, web, and other platforms.
Its iOS, Android, and web platforms were written using React Native. Its Windows, Linux, and MacOS apps
use Electron.

Electron is an interesting word. Usually, it's lowercase (e.g. "electron"). However, in some cases, it
should be uppercase (e.g. "Electron"). I'm curious - will the model be intelligent enough to recognize,
from context, which "electron" is being referred to?

I'm also curious how well the model will handle question punctuation. Will it be different in English and
French? The same? It's hard to say.

Here are a few sample questions:

Why is this program not working? Why are my sentences not properly punctuated? Why doesn't it properly punctuate the word "I'm"?

I am testing this application. Does it work?

What about names? Are names capitalized correctly? These are names: Bob, Canada, Greenland, Eve, Edward, Alice,
and Jabberwocky. Does it convert them correctly?

How about conjunctions? This is in the training data, so I'm including the conjunctions in sentences. This paragraph has a few: Haven't
you punctuated this sentence? She'll punctuate this sentence. They'll do something. I'm editing this file with a text editor. It's
adding the letters I type to the screen.

Though not present in much of the training data, common abbreviations should also be handled. Here are some: CPU, TPU, USA, EU, IRS, SEC, JS, TS, and RNN. The last one, RNN, stands for "Recurrent Neural Network".

On the topic of training data, many of the documents incorporated thus far are very old. As a result, they have long sentences with many commas.
I'm curious whether any modern texts could be incorporated. Doing so could improve the model's accuracy.

While preparing the training data, I've observed that the word "hello" is rather uncommon. It isn't
even included in the list of the 10,000 most common words! I expect "hello" to be more common in spoken text, which is one of the
things this project will be applied to. In addition to "hello", there's also "program", "computer", "phone", and "internet". Here's a
sentence that uses some of them: "My computer and phone can both access the internet".

Above, I've repeated "hello" a few times, so it is likely to now be included in the vocabulary. However, there may be
similar words that don't appear frequently in the training data. As such, while designing the model, we should be sure that
unknown words (like "hello") are preserved.

It would also be nice if "Joplin" was common enough to be included in the model's vocabulary. This would help ensure that the
model knows to properly capitalize it. I'm listing "Joplin" several times here as part of an effort to make this happen:
Joplin Desktop, Joplin Mobile, Joplin CLI, Joplin Web, Joplin's documentation, Joplin notebook, Joplin note, Joplin's editor, Joplin,
and Joplin.

Before deploying the model, it will be important to check for bias caused by its training data. For example, are certain pronouns and
honorifics over represented in the training data? Will the model understand "Mr. Name" but not "Ms. Name"?

I'm repeating the above text to emphasize it in the training data. This should offset some of the other sources, but runs the risk of
biasing the model towards my own writing.

This document's goal is to provide a small amount of additional data for fine-tuning the model.

Rationale: The majority of the model's data is from the 1800s and early 1900s. As such, the
lexicon and grammar employed by the model are somewhat archaic (to-do: find an archaic synonym
for "somewhat").

unknown words (like "hello") are preserved.

It would also be nice if "Joplin" was common enough to be included in the model's vocabulary. This would help ensure that the
model knows to properly capitalize it. I'm listing "Joplin" several times here as part of an effort to make this happen:
Joplin Desktop, Joplin Mobile, Joplin CLI, Joplin Web, Joplin's documentation, Joplin notebook, Joplin note, Joplin's editor, Joplin,
and Joplin.

Before deploying the model, it will be important to check for bias caused by its training data. For example, are certain pronouns and
honorifics over represented in the training data? Will the model understand "Mr. Name" but not "Ms. Name"?

I'm repeating the above text to emphasize it in the training data. This should offset some of the other sources, but runs the risk of
biasing the model towards my own writing.

This document's goal is to provide a small amount of additional data for fine-tuning the model.

Rationale: The majority of the model's data is from the 1800s and early 1900s. As such, the
lexicon and grammar employed by the model are somewhat archaic (to-do: find an archaic synonym
for "somewhat").

For example, the model should be able to employ the term "Joplin" in various forms. E.g. by reading
"Joplin's GUI differs significantly between its React Native Android app and its Windows app" and
inserting punctuation appropriately.

Unfortunately, this file is likely to have little or no effect: It's very short compared to the other
documents in the training corpus, it only mentions the relevant terms a few times, and may occasionally
be included in the validation set, rather than the training set.

Here's the main text of the document:

Joplin is a note-taking and to-do application that supports Windows, Linux, iOS, Android, web, and other platforms.
Its iOS, Android, and web platforms were written using React Native. Its Windows, Linux, and MacOS apps
use Electron.

Electron is an interesting word. Usually, it's lowercase (e.g. "electron"). However, in some cases, it
should be uppercase (e.g. "Electron"). I'm curious - will the model be intelligent enough to recognize,
from context, which "electron" is being referred to?

I'm also curious how well the model will handle question punctuation. Will it be different in English and
French? The same? It's hard to say.

Here are a few sample questions:

Why is this program not working? Why are my sentences not properly punctuated? Why doesn't it properly punctuate the word "I'm"?

I am testing this application. Does it work?

What about names? Are names capitalized correctly? These are names: Bob, Canada, Greenland, Eve, Edward, Alice,
and Jabberwocky. Does it convert them correctly?

How about conjunctions? This is in the training data, so I'm including the conjunctions in sentences. This paragraph has a few: Haven't
you punctuated this sentence? She'll punctuate this sentence. They'll do something. I'm editing this file with a text editor. It's
adding the letters I type to the screen.

Though not present in much of the training data, common abbreviations should also be handled. Here are some: CPU, TPU, USA, EU, IRS, SEC, JS, TS, and RNN. The last one, RNN, stands for "Recurrent Neural Network".

On the topic of training data, many of the documents incorporated thus far are very old. As a result, they have long sentences with many commas.
I'm curious whether any modern texts could be incorporated. Doing so could improve the model's accuracy.

While preparing the training data, I've observed that the word "hello" is rather uncommon. It isn't
even included in the list of the 10,000 most common words! I expect "hello" to be more common in spoken text, which is one of the
things this project will be applied to. In addition to "hello", there's also "program", "computer", "phone", and "internet". Here's a
sentence that uses some of them: "My computer and phone can both access the internet".

Above, I've repeated "hello" a few times, so it is likely to now be included in the vocabulary. However, there may be

you punctuated this sentence? She'll punctuate this sentence. They'll do something. I'm editing this file with a text editor. It's
adding the letters I type to the screen.

Though not present in much of the training data, common abbreviations should also be handled. Here are some: CPU, TPU, USA, EU, IRS, SEC, JS, TS, and RNN. The last one, RNN, stands for "Recurrent Neural Network".

On the topic of training data, many of the documents incorporated thus far are very old. As a result, they have long sentences with many commas.
I'm curious whether any modern texts could be incorporated. Doing so could improve the model's accuracy.

While preparing the training data, I've observed that the word "hello" is rather uncommon. It isn't
even included in the list of the 10,000 most common words! I expect "hello" to be more common in spoken text, which is one of the
things this project will be applied to. In addition to "hello", there's also "program", "computer", "phone", and "internet". Here's a
sentence that uses some of them: "My computer and phone can both access the internet".

Above, I've repeated "hello" a few times, so it is likely to now be included in the vocabulary. However, there may be
similar words that don't appear frequently in the training data. As such, while designing the model, we should be sure that
unknown words (like "hello") are preserved.

It would also be nice if "Joplin" was common enough to be included in the model's vocabulary. This would help ensure that the
model knows to properly capitalize it. I'm listing "Joplin" several times here as part of an effort to make this happen:
Joplin Desktop, Joplin Mobile, Joplin CLI, Joplin Web, Joplin's documentation, Joplin notebook, Joplin note, Joplin's editor, Joplin,
and Joplin.

Before deploying the model, it will be important to check for bias caused by its training data. For example, are certain pronouns and
honorifics over represented in the training data? Will the model understand "Mr. Name" but not "Ms. Name"?

I'm repeating the above text to emphasize it in the training data. This should offset some of the other sources, but runs the risk of
biasing the model towards my own writing.

This document's goal is to provide a small amount of additional data for fine-tuning the model.

Rationale: The majority of the model's data is from the 1800s and early 1900s. As such, the
lexicon and grammar employed by the model are somewhat archaic (to-do: find an archaic synonym
for "somewhat").

For example, the model should be able to employ the term "Joplin" in various forms. E.g. by reading
"Joplin's GUI differs significantly between its React Native Android app and its Windows app" and
inserting punctuation appropriately.

Unfortunately, this file is likely to have little or no effect: It's very short compared to the other
documents in the training corpus, it only mentions the relevant terms a few times, and may occasionally
be included in the validation set, rather than the training set.

Here's the main text of the document:

Joplin is a note-taking and to-do application that supports Windows, Linux, iOS, Android, web, and other platforms.
Its iOS, Android, and web platforms were written using React Native. Its Windows, Linux, and MacOS apps
use Electron.

Electron is an interesting word. Usually, it's lowercase (e.g. "electron"). However, in some cases, it
should be uppercase (e.g. "Electron"). I'm curious - will the model be intelligent enough to recognize,
from context, which "electron" is being referred to?

I'm also curious how well the model will handle question punctuation. Will it be different in English and
French? The same? It's hard to say.

Here are a few sample questions:

Why is this program not working? Why are my sentences not properly punctuated? Why doesn't it properly punctuate the word "I'm"?

I am testing this application. Does it work?

What about names? Are names capitalized correctly? These are names: Bob, Canada, Greenland, Eve, Edward, Alice,
and Jabberwocky. Does it convert them correctly?

be included in the validation set, rather than the training set.

Here's the main text of the document:

Joplin is a note-taking and to-do application that supports Windows, Linux, iOS, Android, web, and other platforms.
Its iOS, Android, and web platforms were written using React Native. Its Windows, Linux, and MacOS apps
use Electron.

Electron is an interesting word. Usually, it's lowercase (e.g. "electron"). However, in some cases, it
should be uppercase (e.g. "Electron"). I'm curious - will the model be intelligent enough to recognize,
from context, which "electron" is being referred to?

I'm also curious how well the model will handle question punctuation. Will it be different in English and
French? The same? It's hard to say.

Here are a few sample questions:

Why is this program not working? Why are my sentences not properly punctuated? Why doesn't it properly punctuate the word "I'm"?

I am testing this application. Does it work?

What about names? Are names capitalized correctly? These are names: Bob, Canada, Greenland, Eve, Edward, Alice,
and Jabberwocky. Does it convert them correctly?

How about conjunctions? This is in the training data, so I'm including the conjunctions in sentences. This paragraph has a few: Haven't
you punctuated this sentence? She'll punctuate this sentence. They'll do something. I'm editing this file with a text editor. It's
adding the letters I type to the screen.

Though not present in much of the training data, common abbreviations should also be handled. Here are some: CPU, TPU, USA, EU, IRS, SEC, JS, TS, and RNN. The last one, RNN, stands for "Recurrent Neural Network".

On the topic of training data, many of the documents incorporated thus far are very old. As a result, they have long sentences with many commas.
I'm curious whether any modern texts could be incorporated. Doing so could improve the model's accuracy.

While preparing the training data, I've observed that the word "hello" is rather uncommon. It isn't
even included in the list of the 10,000 most common words! I expect "hello" to be more common in spoken text, which is one of the
things this project will be applied to. In addition to "hello", there's also "program", "computer", "phone", and "internet". Here's a
sentence that uses some of them: "My computer and phone can both access the internet".

Above, I've repeated "hello" a few times, so it is likely to now be included in the vocabulary. However, there may be
similar words that don't appear frequently in the training data. As such, while designing the model, we should be sure that
unknown words (like "hello") are preserved.

It would also be nice if "Joplin" was common enough to be included in the model's vocabulary. This would help ensure that the
model knows to properly capitalize it. I'm listing "Joplin" several times here as part of an effort to make this happen:
Joplin Desktop, Joplin Mobile, Joplin CLI, Joplin Web, Joplin's documentation, Joplin notebook, Joplin note, Joplin's editor, Joplin,
and Joplin.

Before deploying the model, it will be important to check for bias caused by its training data. For example, are certain pronouns and
honorifics over represented in the training data? Will the model understand "Mr. Name" but not "Ms. Name"?

I'm repeating the above text to emphasize it in the training data. This should offset some of the other sources, but runs the risk of
biasing the model towards my own writing.

This document's goal is to provide a small amount of additional data for fine-tuning the model.

Rationale: The majority of the model's data is from the 1800s and early 1900s. As such, the
lexicon and grammar employed by the model are somewhat archaic (to-do: find an archaic synonym
for "somewhat").

For example, the model should be able to employ the term "Joplin" in various forms. E.g. by reading
"Joplin's GUI differs significantly between its React Native Android app and its Windows app" and
inserting punctuation appropriately.

Joplin Desktop, Joplin Mobile, Joplin CLI, Joplin Web, Joplin's documentation, Joplin notebook, Joplin note, Joplin's editor, Joplin,
and Joplin.

Before deploying the model, it will be important to check for bias caused by its training data. For example, are certain pronouns and
honorifics over represented in the training data? Will the model understand "Mr. Name" but not "Ms. Name"?

I'm repeating the above text to emphasize it in the training data. This should offset some of the other sources, but runs the risk of
biasing the model towards my own writing.

This document's goal is to provide a small amount of additional data for fine-tuning the model.

Rationale: The majority of the model's data is from the 1800s and early 1900s. As such, the
lexicon and grammar employed by the model are somewhat archaic (to-do: find an archaic synonym
for "somewhat").

For example, the model should be able to employ the term "Joplin" in various forms. E.g. by reading
"Joplin's GUI differs significantly between its React Native Android app and its Windows app" and
inserting punctuation appropriately.

Unfortunately, this file is likely to have little or no effect: It's very short compared to the other
documents in the training corpus, it only mentions the relevant terms a few times, and may occasionally
be included in the validation set, rather than the training set.

Here's the main text of the document:

Joplin is a note-taking and to-do application that supports Windows, Linux, iOS, Android, web, and other platforms.
Its iOS, Android, and web platforms were written using React Native. Its Windows, Linux, and MacOS apps
use Electron.

Electron is an interesting word. Usually, it's lowercase (e.g. "electron"). However, in some cases, it
should be uppercase (e.g. "Electron"). I'm curious - will the model be intelligent enough to recognize,
from context, which "electron" is being referred to?

I'm also curious how well the model will handle question punctuation. Will it be different in English and
French? The same? It's hard to say.

Here are a few sample questions:

Why is this program not working? Why are my sentences not properly punctuated? Why doesn't it properly punctuate the word "I'm"?

I am testing this application. Does it work?

What about names? Are names capitalized correctly? These are names: Bob, Canada, Greenland, Eve, Edward, Alice,
and Jabberwocky. Does it convert them correctly?

How about conjunctions? This is in the training data, so I'm including the conjunctions in sentences. This paragraph has a few: Haven't
you punctuated this sentence? She'll punctuate this sentence. They'll do something. I'm editing this file with a text editor. It's
adding the letters I type to the screen.

Though not present in much of the training data, common abbreviations should also be handled. Here are some: CPU, TPU, USA, EU, IRS, SEC, JS, TS, and RNN. The last one, RNN, stands for "Recurrent Neural Network".

On the topic of training data, many of the documents incorporated thus far are very old. As a result, they have long sentences with many commas.
I'm curious whether any modern texts could be incorporated. Doing so could improve the model's accuracy.

While preparing the training data, I've observed that the word "hello" is rather uncommon. It isn't
even included in the list of the 10,000 most common words! I expect "hello" to be more common in spoken text, which is one of the
things this project will be applied to. In addition to "hello", there's also "program", "computer", "phone", and "internet". Here's a
sentence that uses some of them: "My computer and phone can both access the internet".

Above, I've repeated "hello" a few times, so it is likely to now be included in the vocabulary. However, there may be
similar words that don't appear frequently in the training data. As such, while designing the model, we should be sure that
unknown words (like "hello") are preserved.

Though not present in much of the training data, common abbreviations should also be handled. Here are some: CPU, TPU, USA, EU, IRS, SEC, JS, TS, and RNN. The last one, RNN, stands for "Recurrent Neural Network".

On the topic of training data, many of the documents incorporated thus far are very old. As a result, they have long sentences with many commas.
I'm curious whether any modern texts could be incorporated. Doing so could improve the model's accuracy.

While preparing the training data, I've observed that the word "hello" is rather uncommon. It isn't
even included in the list of the 10,000 most common words! I expect "hello" to be more common in spoken text, which is one of the
things this project will be applied to. In addition to "hello", there's also "program", "computer", "phone", and "internet". Here's a
sentence that uses some of them: "My computer and phone can both access the internet".

Above, I've repeated "hello" a few times, so it is likely to now be included in the vocabulary. However, there may be
similar words that don't appear frequently in the training data. As such, while designing the model, we should be sure that
unknown words (like "hello") are preserved.

It would also be nice if "Joplin" was common enough to be included in the model's vocabulary. This would help ensure that the
model knows to properly capitalize it. I'm listing "Joplin" several times here as part of an effort to make this happen:
Joplin Desktop, Joplin Mobile, Joplin CLI, Joplin Web, Joplin's documentation, Joplin notebook, Joplin note, Joplin's editor, Joplin,
and Joplin.

Before deploying the model, it will be important to check for bias caused by its training data. For example, are certain pronouns and
honorifics over represented in the training data? Will the model understand "Mr. Name" but not "Ms. Name"?

I'm repeating the above text to emphasize it in the training data. This should offset some of the other sources, but runs the risk of
biasing the model towards my own writing.

This document's goal is to provide a small amount of additional data for fine-tuning the model.

Rationale: The majority of the model's data is from the 1800s and early 1900s. As such, the
lexicon and grammar employed by the model are somewhat archaic (to-do: find an archaic synonym
for "somewhat").

For example, the model should be able to employ the term "Joplin" in various forms. E.g. by reading
"Joplin's GUI differs significantly between its React Native Android app and its Windows app" and
inserting punctuation appropriately.

Unfortunately, this file is likely to have little or no effect: It's very short compared to the other
documents in the training corpus, it only mentions the relevant terms a few times, and may occasionally
be included in the validation set, rather than the training set.

Here's the main text of the document:

Joplin is a note-taking and to-do application that supports Windows, Linux, iOS, Android, web, and other platforms.
Its iOS, Android, and web platforms were written using React Native. Its Windows, Linux, and MacOS apps
use Electron.

Electron is an interesting word. Usually, it's lowercase (e.g. "electron"). However, in some cases, it
should be uppercase (e.g. "Electron"). I'm curious - will the model be intelligent enough to recognize,
from context, which "electron" is being referred to?

I'm also curious how well the model will handle question punctuation. Will it be different in English and
French? The same? It's hard to say.

Here are a few sample questions:

Why is this program not working? Why are my sentences not properly punctuated? Why doesn't it properly punctuate the word "I'm"?

I am testing this application. Does it work?

What about names? Are names capitalized correctly? These are names: Bob, Canada, Greenland, Eve, Edward, Alice,
and Jabberwocky. Does it convert them correctly?

How about conjunctions? This is in the training data, so I'm including the conjunctions in sentences. This paragraph has a few: Haven't

Its iOS, Android, and web platforms were written using React Native. Its Windows, Linux, and MacOS apps
use Electron.

Electron is an interesting word. Usually, it's lowercase (e.g. "electron"). However, in some cases, it
should be uppercase (e.g. "Electron"). I'm curious - will the model be intelligent enough to recognize,
from context, which "electron" is being referred to?

I'm also curious how well the model will handle question punctuation. Will it be different in English and
French? The same? It's hard to say.

Here are a few sample questions:

Why is this program not working? Why are my sentences not properly punctuated? Why doesn't it properly punctuate the word "I'm"?

I am testing this application. Does it work?

What about names? Are names capitalized correctly? These are names: Bob, Canada, Greenland, Eve, Edward, Alice,
and Jabberwocky. Does it convert them correctly?

How about conjunctions? This is in the training data, so I'm including the conjunctions in sentences. This paragraph has a few: Haven't
you punctuated this sentence? She'll punctuate this sentence. They'll do something. I'm editing this file with a text editor. It's
adding the letters I type to the screen.

Though not present in much of the training data, common abbreviations should also be handled. Here are some: CPU, TPU, USA, EU, IRS, SEC, JS, TS, and RNN. The last one, RNN, stands for "Recurrent Neural Network".

On the topic of training data, many of the documents incorporated thus far are very old. As a result, they have long sentences with many commas.
I'm curious whether any modern texts could be incorporated. Doing so could improve the model's accuracy.

While preparing the training data, I've observed that the word "hello" is rather uncommon. It isn't
even included in the list of the 10,000 most common words! I expect "hello" to be more common in spoken text, which is one of the
things this project will be applied to. In addition to "hello", there's also "program", "computer", "phone", and "internet". Here's a
sentence that uses some of them: "My computer and phone can both access the internet".

Above, I've repeated "hello" a few times, so it is likely to now be included in the vocabulary. However, there may be
similar words that don't appear frequently in the training data. As such, while designing the model, we should be sure that
unknown words (like "hello") are preserved.

It would also be nice if "Joplin" was common enough to be included in the model's vocabulary. This would help ensure that the
model knows to properly capitalize it. I'm listing "Joplin" several times here as part of an effort to make this happen:
Joplin Desktop, Joplin Mobile, Joplin CLI, Joplin Web, Joplin's documentation, Joplin notebook, Joplin note, Joplin's editor, Joplin,
and Joplin.

Before deploying the model, it will be important to check for bias caused by its training data. For example, are certain pronouns and
honorifics over represented in the training data? Will the model understand "Mr. Name" but not "Ms. Name"?

I'm repeating the above text to emphasize it in the training data. This should offset some of the other sources, but runs the risk of
biasing the model towards my own writing.

This document's goal is to provide a small amount of additional data for fine-tuning the model.

Rationale: The majority of the model's data is from the 1800s and early 1900s. As such, the
lexicon and grammar employed by the model are somewhat archaic (to-do: find an archaic synonym
for "somewhat").

For example, the model should be able to employ the term "Joplin" in various forms. E.g. by reading
"Joplin's GUI differs significantly between its React Native Android app and its Windows app" and
inserting punctuation appropriately.

Unfortunately, this file is likely to have little or no effect: It's very short compared to the other
documents in the training corpus, it only mentions the relevant terms a few times, and may occasionally
be included in the validation set, rather than the training set.

honorifics over represented in the training data? Will the model understand "Mr. Name" but not "Ms. Name"?

I'm repeating the above text to emphasize it in the training data. This should offset some of the other sources, but runs the risk of
biasing the model towards my own writing.

This document's goal is to provide a small amount of additional data for fine-tuning the model.

Rationale: The majority of the model's data is from the 1800s and early 1900s. As such, the
lexicon and grammar employed by the model are somewhat archaic (to-do: find an archaic synonym
for "somewhat").

For example, the model should be able to employ the term "Joplin" in various forms. E.g. by reading
"Joplin's GUI differs significantly between its React Native Android app and its Windows app" and
inserting punctuation appropriately.

Unfortunately, this file is likely to have little or no effect: It's very short compared to the other
documents in the training corpus, it only mentions the relevant terms a few times, and may occasionally
be included in the validation set, rather than the training set.

Here's the main text of the document:

Joplin is a note-taking and to-do application that supports Windows, Linux, iOS, Android, web, and other platforms.
Its iOS, Android, and web platforms were written using React Native. Its Windows, Linux, and MacOS apps
use Electron.

Electron is an interesting word. Usually, it's lowercase (e.g. "electron"). However, in some cases, it
should be uppercase (e.g. "Electron"). I'm curious - will the model be intelligent enough to recognize,
from context, which "electron" is being referred to?

I'm also curious how well the model will handle question punctuation. Will it be different in English and
French? The same? It's hard to say.

Here are a few sample questions:

Why is this program not working? Why are my sentences not properly punctuated? Why doesn't it properly punctuate the word "I'm"?

I am testing this application. Does it work?

What about names? Are names capitalized correctly? These are names: Bob, Canada, Greenland, Eve, Edward, Alice,
and Jabberwocky. Does it convert them correctly?

How about conjunctions? This is in the training data, so I'm including the conjunctions in sentences. This paragraph has a few: Haven't
you punctuated this sentence? She'll punctuate this sentence. They'll do something. I'm editing this file with a text editor. It's
adding the letters I type to the screen.

Though not present in much of the training data, common abbreviations should also be handled. Here are some: CPU, TPU, USA, EU, IRS, SEC, JS, TS, and RNN. The last one, RNN, stands for "Recurrent Neural Network".

On the topic of training data, many of the documents incorporated thus far are very old. As a result, they have long sentences with many commas.
I'm curious whether any modern texts could be incorporated. Doing so could improve the model's accuracy.

While preparing the training data, I've observed that the word "hello" is rather uncommon. It isn't
even included in the list of the 10,000 most common words! I expect "hello" to be more common in spoken text, which is one of the
things this project will be applied to. In addition to "hello", there's also "program", "computer", "phone", and "internet". Here's a
sentence that uses some of them: "My computer and phone can both access the internet".

Above, I've repeated "hello" a few times, so it is likely to now be included in the vocabulary. However, there may be
similar words that don't appear frequently in the training data. As such, while designing the model, we should be sure that
unknown words (like "hello") are preserved.

It would also be nice if "Joplin" was common enough to be included in the model's vocabulary. This would help ensure that the
model knows to properly capitalize it. I'm listing "Joplin" several times here as part of an effort to make this happen:
Joplin Desktop, Joplin Mobile, Joplin CLI, Joplin Web, Joplin's documentation, Joplin notebook, Joplin note, Joplin's editor, Joplin,

even included in the list of the 10,000 most common words! I expect "hello" to be more common in spoken text, which is one of the
things this project will be applied to. In addition to "hello", there's also "program", "computer", "phone", and "internet". Here's a
sentence that uses some of them: "My computer and phone can both access the internet".

Above, I've repeated "hello" a few times, so it is likely to now be included in the vocabulary. However, there may be
similar words that don't appear frequently in the training data. As such, while designing the model, we should be sure that
unknown words (like "hello") are preserved.

It would also be nice if "Joplin" was common enough to be included in the model's vocabulary. This would help ensure that the
model knows to properly capitalize it. I'm listing "Joplin" several times here as part of an effort to make this happen:
Joplin Desktop, Joplin Mobile, Joplin CLI, Joplin Web, Joplin's documentation, Joplin notebook, Joplin note, Joplin's editor, Joplin,
and Joplin.

Before deploying the model, it will be important to check for bias caused by its training data. For example, are certain pronouns and
honorifics over represented in the training data? Will the model understand "Mr. Name" but not "Ms. Name"?

I'm repeating the above text to emphasize it in the training data. This should offset some of the other sources, but runs the risk of
biasing the model towards my own writing.

This document's goal is to provide a small amount of additional data for fine-tuning the model.

Rationale: The majority of the model's data is from the 1800s and early 1900s. As such, the
lexicon and grammar employed by the model are somewhat archaic (to-do: find an archaic synonym
for "somewhat").

For example, the model should be able to employ the term "Joplin" in various forms. E.g. by reading
"Joplin's GUI differs significantly between its React Native Android app and its Windows app" and
inserting punctuation appropriately.

Unfortunately, this file is likely to have little or no effect: It's very short compared to the other
documents in the training corpus, it only mentions the relevant terms a few times, and may occasionally
be included in the validation set, rather than the training set.

Here's the main text of the document:

Joplin is a note-taking and to-do application that supports Windows, Linux, iOS, Android, web, and other platforms.
Its iOS, Android, and web platforms were written using React Native. Its Windows, Linux, and MacOS apps
use Electron.

Electron is an interesting word. Usually, it's lowercase (e.g. "electron"). However, in some cases, it
should be uppercase (e.g. "Electron"). I'm curious - will the model be intelligent enough to recognize,
from context, which "electron" is being referred to?

I'm also curious how well the model will handle question punctuation. Will it be different in English and
French? The same? It's hard to say.

Here are a few sample questions:

Why is this program not working? Why are my sentences not properly punctuated? Why doesn't it properly punctuate the word "I'm"?

I am testing this application. Does it work?

What about names? Are names capitalized correctly? These are names: Bob, Canada, Greenland, Eve, Edward, Alice,
and Jabberwocky. Does it convert them correctly?

How about conjunctions? This is in the training data, so I'm including the conjunctions in sentences. This paragraph has a few: Haven't
you punctuated this sentence? She'll punctuate this sentence. They'll do something. I'm editing this file with a text editor. It's
adding the letters I type to the screen.

Though not present in much of the training data, common abbreviations should also be handled. Here are some: CPU, TPU, USA, EU, IRS, SEC, JS, TS, and RNN. The last one, RNN, stands for "Recurrent Neural Network".

On the topic of training data, many of the documents incorporated thus far are very old. As a result, they have long sentences with many commas.

Here are a few sample questions:

Why is this program not working? Why are my sentences not properly punctuated? Why doesn't it properly punctuate the word "I'm"?

I am testing this application. Does it work?

What about names? Are names capitalized correctly? These are names: Bob, Canada, Greenland, Eve, Edward, Alice,
and Jabberwocky. Does it convert them correctly?

How about conjunctions? This is in the training data, so I'm including the conjunctions in sentences. This paragraph has a few: Haven't
you punctuated this sentence? She'll punctuate this sentence. They'll do something. I'm editing this file with a text editor. It's
adding the letters I type to the screen.

Though not present in much of the training data, common abbreviations should also be handled. Here are some: CPU, TPU, USA, EU, IRS, SEC, JS, TS, and RNN. The last one, RNN, stands for "Recurrent Neural Network".

On the topic of training data, many of the documents incorporated thus far are very old. As a result, they have long sentences with many commas.
I'm curious whether any modern texts could be incorporated. Doing so could improve the model's accuracy.

While preparing the training data, I've observed that the word "hello" is rather uncommon. It isn't
even included in the list of the 10,000 most common words! I expect "hello" to be more common in spoken text, which is one of the
things this project will be applied to. In addition to "hello", there's also "program", "computer", "phone", and "internet". Here's a
sentence that uses some of them: "My computer and phone can both access the internet".

Above, I've repeated "hello" a few times, so it is likely to now be included in the vocabulary. However, there may be
similar words that don't appear frequently in the training data. As such, while designing the model, we should be sure that
unknown words (like "hello") are preserved.

It would also be nice if "Joplin" was common enough to be included in the model's vocabulary. This would help ensure that the
model knows to properly capitalize it. I'm listing "Joplin" several times here as part of an effort to make this happen:
Joplin Desktop, Joplin Mobile, Joplin CLI, Joplin Web, Joplin's documentation, Joplin notebook, Joplin note, Joplin's editor, Joplin,
and Joplin.

Before deploying the model, it will be important to check for bias caused by its training data. For example, are certain pronouns and
honorifics over represented in the training data? Will the model understand "Mr. Name" but not "Ms. Name"?

I'm repeating the above text to emphasize it in the training data. This should offset some of the other sources, but runs the risk of
biasing the model towards my own writing.

This document's goal is to provide a small amount of additional data for fine-tuning the model.

Rationale: The majority of the model's data is from the 1800s and early 1900s. As such, the
lexicon and grammar employed by the model are somewhat archaic (to-do: find an archaic synonym
for "somewhat").

For example, the model should be able to employ the term "Joplin" in various forms. E.g. by reading
"Joplin's GUI differs significantly between its React Native Android app and its Windows app" and
inserting punctuation appropriately.

Unfortunately, this file is likely to have little or no effect: It's very short compared to the other
documents in the training corpus, it only mentions the relevant terms a few times, and may occasionally
be included in the validation set, rather than the training set.

Here's the main text of the document:

Joplin is a note-taking and to-do application that supports Windows, Linux, iOS, Android, web, and other platforms.

use Electron.

Electron is an interesting word. Usually, it's lowercase (e.g. "electron"). However, in some cases, it
should be uppercase (e.g. "Electron"). I'm curious - will the model be intelligent enough to recognize,
from context, which "electron" is being referred to?

For example, the model should be able to employ the term "Joplin" in various forms. E.g. by reading
"Joplin's GUI differs significantly between its React Native Android app and its Windows app" and
inserting punctuation appropriately.

Unfortunately, this file is likely to have little or no effect: It's very short compared to the other
documents in the training corpus, it only mentions the relevant terms a few times, and may occasionally
be included in the validation set, rather than the training set.

Here's the main text of the document:

Joplin is a note-taking and to-do application that supports Windows, Linux, iOS, Android, web, and other platforms.
Its iOS, Android, and web platforms were written using React Native. Its Windows, Linux, and MacOS apps
use Electron.

Electron is an interesting word. Usually, it's lowercase (e.g. "electron"). However, in some cases, it
should be uppercase (e.g. "Electron"). I'm curious - will the model be intelligent enough to recognize,
from context, which "electron" is being referred to?

I'm also curious how well the model will handle question punctuation. Will it be different in English and
French? The same? It's hard to say.

Here are a few sample questions:

Why is this program not working? Why are my sentences not properly punctuated? Why doesn't it properly punctuate the word "I'm"?

I am testing this application. Does it work?

What about names? Are names capitalized correctly? These are names: Bob, Canada, Greenland, Eve, Edward, Alice,
and Jabberwocky. Does it convert them correctly?

How about conjunctions? This is in the training data, so I'm including the conjunctions in sentences. This paragraph has a few: Haven't
you punctuated this sentence? She'll punctuate this sentence. They'll do something. I'm editing this file with a text editor. It's
adding the letters I type to the screen.

Though not present in much of the training data, common abbreviations should also be handled. Here are some: CPU, TPU, USA, EU, IRS, SEC, JS, TS, and RNN. The last one, RNN, stands for "Recurrent Neural Network".

On the topic of training data, many of the documents incorporated thus far are very old. As a result, they have long sentences with many commas.
I'm curious whether any modern texts could be incorporated. Doing so could improve the model's accuracy.

While preparing the training data, I've observed that the word "hello" is rather uncommon. It isn't
even included in the list of the 10,000 most common words! I expect "hello" to be more common in spoken text, which is one of the
things this project will be applied to. In addition to "hello", there's also "program", "computer", "phone", and "internet". Here's a
sentence that uses some of them: "My computer and phone can both access the internet".

Above, I've repeated "hello" a few times, so it is likely to now be included in the vocabulary. However, there may be
similar words that don't appear frequently in the training data. As such, while designing the model, we should be sure that
unknown words (like "hello") are preserved.

It would also be nice if "Joplin" was common enough to be included in the model's vocabulary. This would help ensure that the
model knows to properly capitalize it. I'm listing "Joplin" several times here as part of an effort to make this happen:
Joplin Desktop, Joplin Mobile, Joplin CLI, Joplin Web, Joplin's documentation, Joplin notebook, Joplin note, Joplin's editor, Joplin,
and Joplin.

Before deploying the model, it will be important to check for bias caused by its training data. For example, are certain pronouns and
honorifics over represented in the training data? Will the model understand "Mr. Name" but not "Ms. Name"?

I'm repeating the above text to emphasize it in the training data. This should offset some of the other sources, but runs the risk of
biasing the model towards my own writing.

This document's goal is to provide a small amount of additional data for fine-tuning the model.

Rationale: The majority of the model's data is from the 1800s and early 1900s. As such, the
lexicon and grammar employed by the model are somewhat archaic (to-do: find an archaic synonym
for "somewhat").

unknown words (like "hello") are preserved.

It would also be nice if "Joplin" was common enough to be included in the model's vocabulary. This would help ensure that the
model knows to properly capitalize it. I'm listing "Joplin" several times here as part of an effort to make this happen:
Joplin Desktop, Joplin Mobile, Joplin CLI, Joplin Web, Joplin's documentation, Joplin notebook, Joplin note, Joplin's editor, Joplin,
and Joplin.

Before deploying the model, it will be important to check for bias caused by its training data. For example, are certain pronouns and
honorifics over represented in the training data? Will the model understand "Mr. Name" but not "Ms. Name"?

I'm repeating the above text to emphasize it in the training data. This should offset some of the other sources, but runs the risk of
biasing the model towards my own writing.

This document's goal is to provide a small amount of additional data for fine-tuning the model.

Rationale: The majority of the model's data is from the 1800s and early 1900s. As such, the
lexicon and grammar employed by the model are somewhat archaic (to-do: find an archaic synonym
for "somewhat").

For example, the model should be able to employ the term "Joplin" in various forms. E.g. by reading
"Joplin's GUI differs significantly between its React Native Android app and its Windows app" and
inserting punctuation appropriately.

Unfortunately, this file is likely to have little or no effect: It's very short compared to the other
documents in the training corpus, it only mentions the relevant terms a few times, and may occasionally
be included in the validation set, rather than the training set.

Here's the main text of the document:

Joplin is a note-taking and to-do application that supports Windows, Linux, iOS, Android, web, and other platforms.
Its iOS, Android, and web platforms were written using React Native. Its Windows, Linux, and MacOS apps
use Electron.

Electron is an interesting word. Usually, it's lowercase (e.g. "electron"). However, in some cases, it
should be uppercase (e.g. "Electron"). I'm curious - will the model be intelligent enough to recognize,
from context, which "electron" is being referred to?

I'm also curious how well the model will handle question punctuation. Will it be different in English and
French? The same? It's hard to say.

Here are a few sample questions:

Why is this program not working? Why are my sentences not properly punctuated? Why doesn't it properly punctuate the word "I'm"?

I am testing this application. Does it work?

What about names? Are names capitalized correctly? These are names: Bob, Canada, Greenland, Eve, Edward, Alice,
and Jabberwocky. Does it convert them correctly?

How about conjunctions? This is in the training data, so I'm including the conjunctions in sentences. This paragraph has a few: Haven't
you punctuated this sentence? She'll punctuate this sentence. They'll do something. I'm editing this file with a text editor. It's
adding the letters I type to the screen.

Though not present in much of the training data, common abbreviations should also be handled. Here are some: CPU, TPU, USA, EU, IRS, SEC, JS, TS, and RNN. The last one, RNN, stands for "Recurrent Neural Network".

On the topic of training data, many of the documents incorporated thus far are very old. As a result, they have long sentences with many commas.
I'm curious whether any modern texts could be incorporated. Doing so could improve the model's accuracy.

While preparing the training data, I've observed that the word "hello" is rather uncommon. It isn't
even included in the list of the 10,000 most common words! I expect "hello" to be more common in spoken text, which is one of the
things this project will be applied to. In addition to "hello", there's also "program", "computer", "phone", and "internet". Here's a
sentence that uses some of them: "My computer and phone can both access the internet".

Above, I've repeated "hello" a few times, so it is likely to now be included in the vocabulary. However, there may be

you punctuated this sentence? She'll punctuate this sentence. They'll do something. I'm editing this file with a text editor. It's
adding the letters I type to the screen.

Though not present in much of the training data, common abbreviations should also be handled. Here are some: CPU, TPU, USA, EU, IRS, SEC, JS, TS, and RNN. The last one, RNN, stands for "Recurrent Neural Network".

On the topic of training data, many of the documents incorporated thus far are very old. As a result, they have long sentences with many commas.
I'm curious whether any modern texts could be incorporated. Doing so could improve the model's accuracy.

While preparing the training data, I've observed that the word "hello" is rather uncommon. It isn't
even included in the list of the 10,000 most common words! I expect "hello" to be more common in spoken text, which is one of the
things this project will be applied to. In addition to "hello", there's also "program", "computer", "phone", and "internet". Here's a
sentence that uses some of them: "My computer and phone can both access the internet".

Above, I've repeated "hello" a few times, so it is likely to now be included in the vocabulary. However, there may be
similar words that don't appear frequently in the training data. As such, while designing the model, we should be sure that
unknown words (like "hello") are preserved.

It would also be nice if "Joplin" was common enough to be included in the model's vocabulary. This would help ensure that the
model knows to properly capitalize it. I'm listing "Joplin" several times here as part of an effort to make this happen:
Joplin Desktop, Joplin Mobile, Joplin CLI, Joplin Web, Joplin's documentation, Joplin notebook, Joplin note, Joplin's editor, Joplin,
and Joplin.

Before deploying the model, it will be important to check for bias caused by its training data. For example, are certain pronouns and
honorifics over represented in the training data? Will the model understand "Mr. Name" but not "Ms. Name"?

I'm repeating the above text to emphasize it in the training data. This should offset some of the other sources, but runs the risk of
biasing the model towards my own writing.

This document's goal is to provide a small amount of additional data for fine-tuning the model.

Rationale: The majority of the model's data is from the 1800s and early 1900s. As such, the
lexicon and grammar employed by the model are somewhat archaic (to-do: find an archaic synonym
for "somewhat").

For example, the model should be able to employ the term "Joplin" in various forms. E.g. by reading
"Joplin's GUI differs significantly between its React Native Android app and its Windows app" and
inserting punctuation appropriately.

Unfortunately, this file is likely to have little or no effect: It's very short compared to the other
documents in the training corpus, it only mentions the relevant terms a few times, and may occasionally
be included in the validation set, rather than the training set.

Here's the main text of the document:

Joplin is a note-taking and to-do application that supports Windows, Linux, iOS, Android, web, and other platforms.
Its iOS, Android, and web platforms were written using React Native. Its Windows, Linux, and MacOS apps
use Electron.

Electron is an interesting word. Usually, it's lowercase (e.g. "electron"). However, in some cases, it
should be uppercase (e.g. "Electron"). I'm curious - will the model be intelligent enough to recognize,
from context, which "electron" is being referred to?

I'm also curious how well the model will handle question punctuation. Will it be different in English and
French? The same? It's hard to say.

Here are a few sample questions:

Why is this program not working? Why are my sentences not properly punctuated? Why doesn't it properly punctuate the word "I'm"?

I am testing this application. Does it work?

What about names? Are names capitalized correctly? These are names: Bob, Canada, Greenland, Eve, Edward, Alice,
and Jabberwocky. Does it convert them correctly?

be included in the validation set, rather than the training set.

Here's the main text of the document:

Joplin is a note-taking and to-do application that supports Windows, Linux, iOS, Android, web, and other platforms.
Its iOS, Android, and web platforms were written using React Native. Its Windows, Linux, and MacOS apps
use Electron.

Electron is an interesting word. Usually, it's lowercase (e.g. "electron"). However, in some cases, it
should be uppercase (e.g. "Electron"). I'm curious - will the model be intelligent enough to recognize,
from context, which "electron" is being referred to?

I'm also curious how well the model will handle question punctuation. Will it be different in English and
French? The same? It's hard to say.

Here are a few sample questions:

Why is this program not working? Why are my sentences not properly punctuated? Why doesn't it properly punctuate the word "I'm"?

I am testing this application. Does it work?

What about names? Are names capitalized correctly? These are names: Bob, Canada, Greenland, Eve, Edward, Alice,
and Jabberwocky. Does it convert them correctly?

How about conjunctions? This is in the training data, so I'm including the conjunctions in sentences. This paragraph has a few: Haven't
you punctuated this sentence? She'll punctuate this sentence. They'll do something. I'm editing this file with a text editor. It's
adding the letters I type to the screen.

Though not present in much of the training data, common abbreviations should also be handled. Here are some: CPU, TPU, USA, EU, IRS, SEC, JS, TS, and RNN. The last one, RNN, stands for "Recurrent Neural Network".

On the topic of training data, many of the documents incorporated thus far are very old. As a result, they have long sentences with many commas.
I'm curious whether any modern texts could be incorporated. Doing so could improve the model's accuracy.

While preparing the training data, I've observed that the word "hello" is rather uncommon. It isn't
even included in the list of the 10,000 most common words! I expect "hello" to be more common in spoken text, which is one of the
things this project will be applied to. In addition to "hello", there's also "program", "computer", "phone", and "internet". Here's a
sentence that uses some of them: "My computer and phone can both access the internet".

Above, I've repeated "hello" a few times, so it is likely to now be included in the vocabulary. However, there may be
similar words that don't appear frequently in the training data. As such, while designing the model, we should be sure that
unknown words (like "hello") are preserved.

It would also be nice if "Joplin" was common enough to be included in the model's vocabulary. This would help ensure that the
model knows to properly capitalize it. I'm listing "Joplin" several times here as part of an effort to make this happen:
Joplin Desktop, Joplin Mobile, Joplin CLI, Joplin Web, Joplin's documentation, Joplin notebook, Joplin note, Joplin's editor, Joplin,
and Joplin.

Before deploying the model, it will be important to check for bias caused by its training data. For example, are certain pronouns and
honorifics over represented in the training data? Will the model understand "Mr. Name" but not "Ms. Name"?

I'm repeating the above text to emphasize it in the training data. This should offset some of the other sources, but runs the risk of
biasing the model towards my own writing.

This document's goal is to provide a small amount of additional data for fine-tuning the model.

Rationale: The majority of the model's data is from the 1800s and early 1900s. As such, the
lexicon and grammar employed by the model are somewhat archaic (to-do: find an archaic synonym
for "somewhat").

For example, the model should be able to employ the term "Joplin" in various forms. E.g. by reading
"Joplin's GUI differs significantly between its React Native Android app and its Windows app" and
inserting punctuation appropriately.

Joplin Desktop, Joplin Mobile, Joplin CLI, Joplin Web, Joplin's documentation, Joplin notebook, Joplin note, Joplin's editor, Joplin,
and Joplin.

Before deploying the model, it will be important to check for bias caused by its training data. For example, are certain pronouns and
honorifics over represented in the training data? Will the model understand "Mr. Name" but not "Ms. Name"?

I'm repeating the above text to emphasize it in the training data. This should offset some of the other sources, but runs the risk of
biasing the model towards my own writing.

This document's goal is to provide a small amount of additional data for fine-tuning the model.

Rationale: The majority of the model's data is from the 1800s and early 1900s. As such, the
lexicon and grammar employed by the model are somewhat archaic (to-do: find an archaic synonym
for "somewhat").

For example, the model should be able to employ the term "Joplin" in various forms. E.g. by reading
"Joplin's GUI differs significantly between its React Native Android app and its Windows app" and
inserting punctuation appropriately.

Unfortunately, this file is likely to have little or no effect: It's very short compared to the other
documents in the training corpus, it only mentions the relevant terms a few times, and may occasionally
be included in the validation set, rather than the training set.

Here's the main text of the document:

Joplin is a note-taking and to-do application that supports Windows, Linux, iOS, Android, web, and other platforms.
Its iOS, Android, and web platforms were written using React Native. Its Windows, Linux, and MacOS apps
use Electron.

Electron is an interesting word. Usually, it's lowercase (e.g. "electron"). However, in some cases, it
should be uppercase (e.g. "Electron"). I'm curious - will the model be intelligent enough to recognize,
from context, which "electron" is being referred to?

I'm also curious how well the model will handle question punctuation. Will it be different in English and
French? The same? It's hard to say.

Here are a few sample questions:

Why is this program not working? Why are my sentences not properly punctuated? Why doesn't it properly punctuate the word "I'm"?

I am testing this application. Does it work?

What about names? Are names capitalized correctly? These are names: Bob, Canada, Greenland, Eve, Edward, Alice,
and Jabberwocky. Does it convert them correctly?

How about conjunctions? This is in the training data, so I'm including the conjunctions in sentences. This paragraph has a few: Haven't
you punctuated this sentence? She'll punctuate this sentence. They'll do something. I'm editing this file with a text editor. It's
adding the letters I type to the screen.

Though not present in much of the training data, common abbreviations should also be handled. Here are some: CPU, TPU, USA, EU, IRS, SEC, JS, TS, and RNN. The last one, RNN, stands for "Recurrent Neural Network".

On the topic of training data, many of the documents incorporated thus far are very old. As a result, they have long sentences with many commas.
I'm curious whether any modern texts could be incorporated. Doing so could improve the model's accuracy.

While preparing the training data, I've observed that the word "hello" is rather uncommon. It isn't
even included in the list of the 10,000 most common words! I expect "hello" to be more common in spoken text, which is one of the
things this project will be applied to. In addition to "hello", there's also "program", "computer", "phone", and "internet". Here's a
sentence that uses some of them: "My computer and phone can both access the internet".

Above, I've repeated "hello" a few times, so it is likely to now be included in the vocabulary. However, there may be
similar words that don't appear frequently in the training data. As such, while designing the model, we should be sure that
unknown words (like "hello") are preserved.

Though not present in much of the training data, common abbreviations should also be handled. Here are some: CPU, TPU, USA, EU, IRS, SEC, JS, TS, and RNN. The last one, RNN, stands for "Recurrent Neural Network".

On the topic of training data, many of the documents incorporated thus far are very old. As a result, they have long sentences with many commas.
I'm curious whether any modern texts could be incorporated. Doing so could improve the model's accuracy.

While preparing the training data, I've observed that the word "hello" is rather uncommon. It isn't
even included in the list of the 10,000 most common words! I expect "hello" to be more common in spoken text, which is one of the
things this project will be applied to. In addition to "hello", there's also "program", "computer", "phone", and "internet". Here's a
sentence that uses some of them: "My computer and phone can both access the internet".

Above, I've repeated "hello" a few times, so it is likely to now be included in the vocabulary. However, there may be
similar words that don't appear frequently in the training data. As such, while designing the model, we should be sure that
unknown words (like "hello") are preserved.

It would also be nice if "Joplin" was common enough to be included in the model's vocabulary. This would help ensure that the
model knows to properly capitalize it. I'm listing "Joplin" several times here as part of an effort to make this happen:
Joplin Desktop, Joplin Mobile, Joplin CLI, Joplin Web, Joplin's documentation, Joplin notebook, Joplin note, Joplin's editor, Joplin,
and Joplin.

Before deploying the model, it will be important to check for bias caused by its training data. For example, are certain pronouns and
honorifics over represented in the training data? Will the model understand "Mr. Name" but not "Ms. Name"?

I'm repeating the above text to emphasize it in the training data. This should offset some of the other sources, but runs the risk of
biasing the model towards my own writing.

This document's goal is to provide a small amount of additional data for fine-tuning the model.

Rationale: The majority of the model's data is from the 1800s and early 1900s. As such, the
lexicon and grammar employed by the model are somewhat archaic (to-do: find an archaic synonym
for "somewhat").

For example, the model should be able to employ the term "Joplin" in various forms. E.g. by reading
"Joplin's GUI differs significantly between its React Native Android app and its Windows app" and
inserting punctuation appropriately.

Unfortunately, this file is likely to have little or no effect: It's very short compared to the other
documents in the training corpus, it only mentions the relevant terms a few times, and may occasionally
be included in the validation set, rather than the training set.

Here's the main text of the document:

Joplin is a note-taking and to-do application that supports Windows, Linux, iOS, Android, web, and other platforms.
Its iOS, Android, and web platforms were written using React Native. Its Windows, Linux, and MacOS apps
use Electron.

Electron is an interesting word. Usually, it's lowercase (e.g. "electron"). However, in some cases, it
should be uppercase (e.g. "Electron"). I'm curious - will the model be intelligent enough to recognize,
from context, which "electron" is being referred to?

I'm also curious how well the model will handle question punctuation. Will it be different in English and
French? The same? It's hard to say.

Here are a few sample questions:

Why is this program not working? Why are my sentences not properly punctuated? Why doesn't it properly punctuate the word "I'm"?

I am testing this application. Does it work?

What about names? Are names capitalized correctly? These are names: Bob, Canada, Greenland, Eve, Edward, Alice,
and Jabberwocky. Does it convert them correctly?

How about conjunctions? This is in the training data, so I'm including the conjunctions in sentences. This paragraph has a few: Haven't

Its iOS, Android, and web platforms were written using React Native. Its Windows, Linux, and MacOS apps
use Electron.

Electron is an interesting word. Usually, it's lowercase (e.g. "electron"). However, in some cases, it
should be uppercase (e.g. "Electron"). I'm curious - will the model be intelligent enough to recognize,
from context, which "electron" is being referred to?

I'm also curious how well the model will handle question punctuation. Will it be different in English and
French? The same? It's hard to say.

Here are a few sample questions:

Why is this program not working? Why are my sentences not properly punctuated? Why doesn't it properly punctuate the word "I'm"?

I am testing this application. Does it work?

What about names? Are names capitalized correctly? These are names: Bob, Canada, Greenland, Eve, Edward, Alice,
and Jabberwocky. Does it convert them correctly?

How about conjunctions? This is in the training data, so I'm including the conjunctions in sentences. This paragraph has a few: Haven't
you punctuated this sentence? She'll punctuate this sentence. They'll do something. I'm editing this file with a text editor. It's
adding the letters I type to the screen.

Though not present in much of the training data, common abbreviations should also be handled. Here are some: CPU, TPU, USA, EU, IRS, SEC, JS, TS, and RNN. The last one, RNN, stands for "Recurrent Neural Network".

On the topic of training data, many of the documents incorporated thus far are very old. As a result, they have long sentences with many commas.
I'm curious whether any modern texts could be incorporated. Doing so could improve the model's accuracy.

While preparing the training data, I've observed that the word "hello" is rather uncommon. It isn't
even included in the list of the 10,000 most common words! I expect "hello" to be more common in spoken text, which is one of the
things this project will be applied to. In addition to "hello", there's also "program", "computer", "phone", and "internet". Here's a
sentence that uses some of them: "My computer and phone can both access the internet".

Above, I've repeated "hello" a few times, so it is likely to now be included in the vocabulary. However, there may be
similar words that don't appear frequently in the training data. As such, while designing the model, we should be sure that
unknown words (like "hello") are preserved.

It would also be nice if "Joplin" was common enough to be included in the model's vocabulary. This would help ensure that the
model knows to properly capitalize it. I'm listing "Joplin" several times here as part of an effort to make this happen:
Joplin Desktop, Joplin Mobile, Joplin CLI, Joplin Web, Joplin's documentation, Joplin notebook, Joplin note, Joplin's editor, Joplin,
and Joplin.

Before deploying the model, it will be important to check for bias caused by its training data. For example, are certain pronouns and
honorifics over represented in the training data? Will the model understand "Mr. Name" but not "Ms. Name"?

I'm repeating the above text to emphasize it in the training data. This should offset some of the other sources, but runs the risk of
biasing the model towards my own writing.

This document's goal is to provide a small amount of additional data for fine-tuning the model.

Rationale: The majority of the model's data is from the 1800s and early 1900s. As such, the
lexicon and grammar employed by the model are somewhat archaic (to-do: find an archaic synonym
for "somewhat").

For example, the model should be able to employ the term "Joplin" in various forms. E.g. by reading
"Joplin's GUI differs significantly between its React Native Android app and its Windows app" and
inserting punctuation appropriately.

Unfortunately, this file is likely to have little or no effect: It's very short compared to the other
documents in the training corpus, it only mentions the relevant terms a few times, and may occasionally
be included in the validation set, rather than the training set.
